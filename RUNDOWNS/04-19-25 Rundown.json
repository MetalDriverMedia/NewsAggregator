    "body": "Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More\n\nSoftware companies have a lot of decisions to make as they move through the stages of building a thriving business. Among the many issues to debate is whether or not to open source their technology. It’s a big decision, and the licensing around open source receives a lot of attention in tech circles. \n\nPart of the issue is that open source comes with a lot of strong opinions. Whenever a large company decides to restrict its license, even if it’s for valid reasons, they can receive a lot of backlash (as HashiCorp and Elastic learned in recent years). On the other hand, excellent tech that’s released as open source can quickly gather a lot of support from the open-source software (OSS) community. \n\nIt’s not easy for enterprises to decide which path to take. My company chose to release our cloud native security scanner, Kubescape, as open source through the Linux Foundation’s Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and we’re extremely happy with the decision. In fact, Kubescape was recently promoted to incubating project status and is used by thousands of enterprises globally. Overall, we see it as a net benefit, but we did carefully weigh up the pros and cons before we took the plunge. It’s definitely not something to rush into, so I’m sharing some advice based on our experience. \n\nDevOps teams have many good reasons to be reluctant to introduce new code into their clusters and environments: It could be full of bugs, undermine their security setup and/or mess up their existing configurations. Unless you’re offering a solution that’s entirely SaaS and doesn’t require any agent-based / in-cluster/on-prem installation, you’ll need to overcome these hesitations from DevOps. \n\nGoing open source can help with this. It signals transparency and accountability, and gives teams the opportunity to inspect code while contributing new code or opening issues that makes them part of the project and gives them the ability to influence its roadmap. They’re more likely to trust a solution that invites them to check the core code than one that asks them to trust a closed box.\n\nThis trust is amplified if you donate your code to a foundation that has credibility and a lively community base with a strong “cool” factor. A reputable foundation helps validate the quality of your product and testifies that you’ve implemented the right review processes, cadences and governance. It’s even better when your OSS offering has already achieved significant traction, a large install base and a certain amount of popularity in the community. \n\nContinuous improvement is more than just a slogan. You want to find and fix bugs and improve your offering as fast as possible, and the best way to do that is to ramp up usage. Going open source means that your technology gets road-tested in the real world by far more users than you could reach through private sales. \n\nWe found that our platform was present in more than 200,000 clusters at a time when we still had only several dozen enterprise customers. That enabled us to draw on the feedback, feature requests and validation of a massive user base, so we could learn and roll out improvements more quickly. \n\nAt the same time, adoption increased, partly due to our greater reach, and partly because our product was improving at such a rapid rate. It’s possible to use your open-source community as a test environment, then release changes in the enterprise version once you’ve incorporated feedback and the version is stable, or vice versa. It’s good to have the dual options running simultaneously. \n\nThose are the main advantages, but there are also drawbacks to open source, and it’s vital to keep them in mind. The main downside is that when your product is open source, you can’t control how people use it. That’s especially true if you decide to open source it through a community forum, since you’re essentially handing over your trademarks to a vendor neutral foundation. \n\nDespite the widespread trust throughout the open-source community, there will still be some who’ll just use your open-source code and avoid your for-pay versions and features. (Of course, you can and should consider these free users as part of your sales pipeline, and work to upgrade them to the enterprise version for additional features and benefits). \n\nThere will even be some people who’ll take your hard work and use it to build a commercial product and make money off your innovation and the work of the community that you built and curated. You need to make your peace with this, because you can’t stop it from happening. \n\nOne of the main factors in deciding open-source projects is your user base. You need to know and understand their concerns and motivations, so you can correctly predict how they’ll respond to an OSS offering. If your audience is very technical, such as security engineers, DevOps teams and developers, they’re more likely to fall into the pro-open source camp. \n\nThere’s a reason why we call it the ‘open-source community.’ Open source is more than just a license decision: It’s a set of shared beliefs, with participants who go way beyond customers. It’s closer to a religion or a cult than a purchasing choice. If your user base shares your love for the idea of open source, this path is a lot more likely to succeed. \n\nEstablishing a firm pathway to monetization is crucial for any enterprise, but it’s doubly important for open-source companies. You have to be clear about how you’ll make your money, because open source could leave you without a strong cash flow. \n\nFor example, you might choose to make all your tech entirely open source for a year, to drive penetration and feedback, then introduce monetization methods. You could go open core, which is the route my company chose, where you offer your core code as open source, then sell additional services and features on top. \n\nMany companies decide to offer both an OSS version and an enterprise version. This can work, but you need to strike the right balance between the functionality and support that’s included in the OSS version, and that which you provide only for paying customers. Another option is to set things up so that the open-source code can only be used in combination with the enterprise version. The OSS version doesn’t have any value except to demonstrate transparency. The thing to be aware of, though, is that this can conflict with working with a foundation.\n\nGoing open source is a very weighty decision. It doesn’t help that it’s pretty much a one-way street. You can move from closed source to open source, or from a more restrictive license to a more open license, whenever you like, and you’ll receive nothing but applause from the tech community. \n\nBut it can be very difficult to move in the other direction. All the code and information that you’ve already shared will be available to the public forever, so they can use it whenever and however they like. And as mentioned above, open source fans can be very critical of anyone who walks back their OSS offering, so they’re less likely to respect your code. HashiCorp learned this the hard way when fans forked Terraform after they changed from an NPL to a BSL license. \n\nThat said, open source can be awesome when the circumstances are right. If you’ve weighed up all the factors, your user base and tech offering align, and you’ve identified a reputable foundation that believes in your mission, you can benefit from a slew of advantages, like we have. \n\nShauli Rozen is the CEO and cofounder of ARMO and the creator of Kubescape.\n\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

(2:03)\n\nDENVER -- Nikola Jokic scored 29 points and Aaron Gordon added 25, including a pair of free throws with 12 seconds left, and the Denver Nuggets roared back from a 15-point first-half deficit to power past the LA Clippers 112-110 in overtime Saturday in the opener of their Western Conference playoff series.\n\nJamal Murray added 21 points, nine boards and seven assists for the fourth-seeded Nuggets, who improved to 4-0 under interim coach David Adelman, Michael Malone's replacement.\n\nThe No. 5 seed Clippers' loss was their first since March 30 at Cleveland. They rolled into the playoffs having won 18 of 21, including their past eight, and they jumped out to an early lead that held until the final minutes of regulation.\n\nRussell Westbrook came up big at the end of regulation with an uncontested corner 3 for a 98-96 Denver lead, and again in overtime when he knocked the inbounds pass away from -- and off of -- James Harden with 9.6 seconds left and Denver clinging to a 3-point lead.\n\nThe clutch 3-pointer from Westbrook marked his first career go-ahead 3 inside the final 30 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime in his playoff career, according to ESPN Research.\n\nJokic was fouled on the ensuing inbounds play and his two free throws made it 112-107 before Norman Powell's buzzer 3-pointer.\n\nAfter Westbrook's 3-pointer from the left corner, Harden responded with a floater to tie it and the Nuggets couldn't get off a shot in the final 18 seconds.\n\nJokic had 12 assists and finished one rebound shy of a triple-double. Harden led the Clippers with 32 points. Kawhi Leonard added 27 and Ivica Zubac had 21.\n\nThese teams last met in the playoffs in 2020 at the Walt Disney World in the pandemic bubble, when the Nuggets overcame a 3-1 deficit to beat the Clippers.",

    "body": "Researchers have developed a new coronagraph -- an optical device that blocks out light from a bright source -- that could make it possible to see distant exoplanets obscured by light from their parent stars. The new device could reveal exoplanets beyond our solar system that today's telescopes cannot resolve, providing insights into the possibility of life beyond Earth.\n\n\"Earth-like planets in the habitable zone -- the region around a star where temperatures could allow liquid water to exist -- can easily be up to a billion times dimmer than their host star,\" said research team leader Nico Deshler from the University of Arizona. \"This makes them difficult to detect because their faint light is overwhelmed by the star's brightness. Our new coronagraph design siphons away starlight that might obscure exoplanet light before capturing an image.\"\n\nIn Optica, the researchers show that the new coronagraph can theoretically achieve the fundamental limits of exoplanet detection and localization set by quantum optics. They also used it to capture images that allowed them to estimate the position of artificial exoplanets with distances from their host star up to 50 times smaller than what the telescope's resolution limit would normally allow.\n\n\"Compared to other coronagraph designs, ours promises to supply more information about so-called sub-diffraction exoplanets -- those which lie below the resolution limits of the telescope,\" said Deshler. \"This could allow us to potentially detect biosignatures and discover the presence of life among the stars.\"\n\nOptically analyzing exoplanets poses a formidable challenge because, at astronomical scales, they are often too close to their parent star for current telescopes to resolve. Exoplanets can also be orders of magnitude dimmer than their host star. Although astronomers have developed various ways to indirectly infer the presence of a planet around a prospective star, directly observing exoplanets in images would be ideal.\n\nWith NASA's next-generation space telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), being dedicated to exoplanet science, many coronagraph designs have emerged, each with different practical and theoretical performance trade-offs. At the same time, recent work has shown that traditional notions of resolution for telescopes do not reflect fundamental limits and can be circumvented with careful optical pre-processing.\n\nInspired by these developments, the researchers decided to use a spatial mode sorter available in their lab to develop an improved coronagraph that theoretically rejects all the light from an on-axis star while achieving maximal throughput of an off-axis exoplanet.\n\nMuch like piano notes emit different acoustic frequencies, light sources in space excite different spatial modes -- unique shapes and patterns of oscillation -- depending on their position. The researchers separated these different modes using a mode sorter to isolate and eliminate light from a star and an inverse mode sorter to recompose the optical field after the starlight is rejected. This made it possible to capture an image of the exoplanet without the star.\n\n\"Our coronagraph directly captures an image of the exoplanet, as opposed to measuring only the quantity of light from the exoplanet without any spatial orientation,\" said Deshler. \"Images can provide context and composition information that can be used to determine exoplanet orbits and identify other objects that scatter light from a star such as exozodiacal dust clouds.\"\n\nAfter configuring their coronagraph in the lab, the researchers constructed an artificial star-exoplanet scene in which the exoplanet was positioned close enough to the star to be unresolvable with a traditional telescope. The contrast ratio between the star and the planet was set to 1000:1.\n\nThe researchers scanned the position of the exoplanet to simulate an orbit where the planet traverses in front of the star and then tried to determine its position in each frame. The images captured with their experimental setup incorporating the new coronagraph allowed them to estimate the position of the exoplanet at sub-diffraction planet-star separations.\n\nThe researchers are working to improve the mode sorter to reduce crosstalk, a type of interference in which light leaks across different optical modes. For scenes with moderate contrast levels, crosstalk is not very problematic. However, the extreme contrasts found in exoplanet science would require a very high-fidelity spatial mode sorter to sufficiently isolate light from the star.\n\nThe researchers say that this proof-of-principle experiment could inspire further exploration of optical pre-processing with spatial mode sorters in future astronomical instrumentation. For example, the spatial mode filtering methods they used could address more complex scenarios, such as treating stars as extended objects, and may also lead to new imaging methods for quantum sensing, medical imaging and communications.\n\nMaterials provided by Optica.

    "body": " Blindness is completely or severely reduced vision. Contrary to popular belief, most people who are blind have some vision—only about 15% of blindness results in total vision loss. Blindness can occur at any point in life, but it's most common with age.\n\n\n Blindness symptoms depend on the cause but typically include low vision accompanied by blurred vision, hazy or cloudy vision, and poor night vision. People may experience challenges with daily living activities such as driving, working, reading, and doing chores. \n\n\n Some people may be born blind. Blindness can also occur suddenly, such as in an accident, though it usually develops slowly. Not all blindness can be prevented, but several lifestyle modifications can greatly reduce your chances of developing the underlying conditions that cause blindness. \n\n\n There are several types of blindness, each of which describe forms of total or severe vision loss.\n\n\n People with total blindness cannot see anything, including any light. Total blindness is not a common form of blindness—85% of blind people can see to some extent. \n\n\n Individuals with partial blindness have some ability to see, but it's greatly impaired. Glasses or contacts cannot fully correct their vision, and their low vision affects their daily life. \n\n\n This type of blindness describes people born blind or with eye conditions that lead to blindness in early life. Examples include retinitis pigmentosa, a condition that runs in families, in which people slowly lose their night vision and peripheral vision. \n\n\n Blindness that qualifies for disability and other benefits in the United States is considered legal blindness. If you have a central visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in your better eye with glasses or contacts, or your visual field is restricted to 20 degrees or less in your better eye, you may qualify for legal blindness.\n\n\n Not everyone who is blind has full vision loss. Most people who are blind experience a gradual loss of vision over time. Symptoms of vision loss include:\n\n\n Most people experience some symptoms of vision loss as they get older. You may notice over time that you need reading glasses, for example. However, gradual vision loss may also be a sign of an undiagnosed health condition that can lead to blindness. That’s why it’s important to have regular eye exams.\n\n\n Vision is a complex process that requires the coordination of many different parts of your eyes and brain. Diseases, structural differences, and injuries can affect this process. Causes of vision loss and blindness include:\n\n\n These are only a few of the many causes of blindness. Although most blindness occurs with age, other forms of blindness occur during childhood, which can have a variety of causes. Blindness can also occur after a traumatic injury to the eye.\n\n\n An optometrist or ophthalmologist can diagnose blindness. An optometrist is an eye doctor who specializes in routine eye exams and can diagnose and treat some eye conditions. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in a range of eye conditions. \n\n\n Your healthcare provider will likely conduct multiple eye tests to check your visual acuity (clarity of vision) and visual field (range of vision). They may perform additional tests, such as a retinal scan or a dilated eye exam, to better understand how your eyes work. \n\n\n Your healthcare provider will also ask about your health history, including questions about diabetes, high blood pressure, your occupation, and your smoking status. They will also ask about any family history of eye diseases or blindness.\n\n\n Treatment for blindness focuses on managing the underlying cause of your vision loss. In most cases, the vision loss is permanent. However, slowing the progression of vision loss is key. Some treatments for blindness include:\n\n\n Other resources include service animals such as guide dogs. Your healthcare provider may also prescribe vision rehabilitation to help you better manage living with low vision. \n\n\n In some cases, blindness isn't preventable. In other cases, you may be able to prevent or slow the progression of your vision loss. Getting regular eye health exams every 1-2 years is an important step you can take to catch potential causes of vision loss early.\n\n\n Other prevention strategies include the following:\n\n\n Several chronic (long-term) conditions may increase your risk of developing blindness. That’s why managing them with your healthcare provider is important in preventing blindness. These conditions include diabetes and high blood pressure. Additionally, cataracts can cause blindness if they're not surgically removed. \n\n\n Many resources are available to help those with severe vision loss. If you're legally blind, you may qualify for government assistance, including:\n\n\n You may also be eligible for services to help with your day-to-day tasks, such as:\n\n\n If you want to learn more about potential services, talk with your healthcare provider, human resources at work, or disability services at school. You can also learn more online from the Social Security Administration. \n\n\nBlindness may or may not be reversible depending on the cause. For example, if you have a condition like macular degeneration, you won’t be able to restore your vision. If you have low vision from cataracts, eye surgery to remove the cataracts may improve your vision.\n\nSeveral conditions may cause sudden vision loss, such as an eye injury. Other causes include strokes, retinal detachment, and problems with the arteries that provide blood to the eyes.\n\nMost people who are blind can see to some extent, and many who are blind were not born blind. These individuals can dream similarly to people who have normal vision. People who were born blind still dream, but the way they experience the dream may be different. For example, they may rely more on emotions and physical sensations such as touch rather than sight.\n\nLee SY, Gurnani B, Mesfin FB. Blindness. In: StatPearls.

    "body": "Ryan Coogler, the Academy Award-nominated director of Creed and Black Panther, hasn’t been shy at all about citing the various inspirations behind his new horror thriller Sinners. In the weeks leading up to the film’s premiere, Coogler has been making the rounds along the press circuit, drumming up excitement and talking at length about the creative process behind his latest original feature. “It’s a genre-fluid film,” Coogler told SciFiNow in January. “There are vampires in the film, okay, but it’s really about a lot more than just that. It’s one of many elements and I think we’re gonna surprise people with it.”\n\nCoogler’s right; there’s a lot more to Sinners than first meets the eye, and that’s especially apparent from the breadth of influences Coogler has pulled from while writing the film’s script. He’s cited From Dusk Till Dawn, The Faculty, the oeuvre of the Coen brothers, and even Puss in Boots: The Last Wish as inspirations behind Sinners, though the most intriguing reference he’s nodded to might be a lesser-known episode of Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone.\n\n“Truthfully, the biggest influences are not in cinema,” Coogler told SciFiNow. “The novel Salem’s Lot is a massive influence on the film. Then there’s a real deep-cut influence. My favorite thing ever made is The Twilight Zone, and my favorite episode is called ‘The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank’ – probably Salem’s Lot and ‘The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank’ are probably the biggest influences.”\n\nPremiering in the third season of The Twilight Zone, the episode centers on Jeff Myrtlebank, a young man living in a small town in the southernmost section of the Midwest who mysteriously returns to life at his own funeral, much to the shock of his loved ones and pastor. Despite their reasonable trepidation, the townspeople declare it a miracle — that is, until rumors begin to swirl regarding minor yet noticeable shifts in Jeff’s behavior following his unexpected resurrection.\n\n“I’m real concerned,” Jeff’s mother tells her husband over breakfast. “He only ate two eggs again; why, ever since he’s sprouted teeth he’s been having three eggs at breakfast.” Jeff’s father notices a change in Jeff as well. “I recollect worrying many times that he leaned just a shade towards the side of shiftlessness,” he says. “And since his sickness, he’s been fighting in that work just like he was a year behind.”\n\nEventually, these idle rumors become fodder for suspicion and outright hatred of Jeff’s newfound character and candor. It gets so bad that even Comfort Gatewood, Jeff’s own fiancée, begins to doubt that Jeff is who he says he is. “I expect it from the others, but not from you, Comfort,” Jeff tells her in frustration. “I’m getting sick and tired the way everybody treats me like a vampire.”\n\nThe conclusion of the episode leaves the question of Jeff’s true nature, as well as that of his resurrection, tantalizingly unanswered, but the most intriguing connection between “The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank” and Coogler’s Sinners is evident in its penultimate moment. When Jeff is surrounded by a group of angry neighbors, Comfort’s brother Orgram accuses him of being a “haint,” a ghostly presence believed to possess the bodies of mortal men for its own nefarious purposes. This same term appears in Sinners, when Wunmi Mosaku’s character, Annie, speaks about the power of music to rend asunder the veil dividing the world of the living and the dead.\n\nEven apart from its connection to Coogler’s latest film, however, “The Last Rites of Jeff Myrtlebank” is a terrific Twilight Zone episode that knows that the most interesting questions are often best left unanswered. It may not be as iconic as “Nightmare at 20000 Feet” or “Five Characters in Search of an Exit,” but it’s nevertheless a great episode to watch whether or not you plan on venturing out to the theater to see Sinners.\n\nThe Twilight Zone is available to stream on Pluto TV and Paramount Plus.",

    "body": "\n\tIt’s April 7, 2024, and WWE Superstar Jey Uso can barely believe his luck. He’s a major player at the biggest event in wrestling history, WrestleMania 40, and he’s pitted against his own twin Jimmy in a dream match they’ve wanted since being kids.\n\n\n\tJey’s fighting his brother in front of more than 60,000 people at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field and millions more watching on TV or online. And the cherry on the top? Jey is being escorted to the ring by his all-time favorite rapper, wrestling fan Lil Wayne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tVIP+\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCeltics Sale Shows Media’s New Pot of Gold: Sports Teams as Mega-Brands \t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t'Star Wars Zero Company' Game to Launch in 2026 From Electronic Arts, Story Set During the Clone Wars\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThere’s just one problem: Jey vs. Jimmy is slated for early in the program, and the famously tardy Lil Wayne is a little late — but, uncharacteristically, just a little. Jey vs. Jimmy is match number four, and Wayne makes it to the building in time. Weezy is introduced as the “Greatest Rapper of All-Time,” and comes out to “A Milli.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAs the crowd begins rocking to the music, the song comes to a halt as the yell of “Uuuuuuso!” hits the speakers and Jey’s popular entrance theme “Main Event Ish” begins playing. The energy rises as the wrestler and the rapper take energetic strides and bounce to the ring.\n\n\n\t“It’s on you!” Wayne yells, ad libbing the chorus of the song “It’s just me Uce/ Day one ish!” The fans shout Jey’s signature catch-term, “Yeet!!” in unison and stretch their arms forward, waving them up and down to the beat.\n\n\n\t“Full circle, Uce,” Jey tells Variety of the moment, nearly a year later. (He endearingly calls most people “Uce,” short for “Uso,” which means brother in his Samoan heritage.) \n\n\n\tHe’s chilling in the famed New York sneaker store, Flight Club, a day after he wrestled at Madison Square Garden. He smiles wide while talking about Lil Wayne.\n\n\n\t“He’s really my favorite rapper,” he enthuses. “I go back to early Wayne, Hot Boys, the first “Carter” album. When I first started wrestling [on the independent circuit], me and my brother would come out to Lil Wayne’s ‘Go DJ.’ To have him walk me out meand rapping, it was a full circle for me. Wayne is the best rapper alive for real.”\n\n\n\tThe Mania 40 moment and the crowd’s reaction wasn’t just taken in by fans, it was noticed by WWE executives. They have the biggest, most reliable focus group right in front of them. Jey isn’t just a pillar of the WWE, he’s become an official face of the company.  \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“I’m so proud of Jey,” T-Pain, who was in the floor seats at Mania that night, tells Variety. “He deserves it, bro. I think everyone knows and feels it.”\n\n\n\tJey’s rocketed rise the past few years even has a nickname, “The Yeet Movement.” His ring entrance has become so endearing that now he doesn’t come out from the back, he walks through the crowd, through the mezzanine levels and down the steps while the fans scream “Yeet!”\n\n\n\t“Yeet” is a longstanding hip-hop slang term so widespread that it has two definitions in the Merriam-Webster dictionary, as an interjection (“used to express surprise, approval, or excited enthusiasm”) and, even funnier, as a verb (“to throw especially with force and without regard for the thing being thrown”). It has been brought to the forefront by Jey, who also uses it as a greeting or term of endearment. Merch bearing the word sells in the millions; WWE even introduced a Jey Uso cereal called “Frosted Yeet” for this year’s WrestleMania.  \n\n\n\t“Jey is that special kind of superstar,” WWE Analyst and Sirius XM host Sam Roberts tells Variety. “I knew he was different with Jey when one of the WWE Premium Live Events this year, they showed a shot of the audience: Lots of people were wearing Yeet T-shirts, and Jey wasn’t even on the show. That’s a different type of connection.”\n\n\n\tLike the Rock before him, Jey is undoubtedly a people’s champ. He wins crowds over with his emotion and sincerity in the ring and in promos, where he’ll break character and laugh or even cry, not to mention the undeniable swag — glasses, gold teeth, the rhythm as he walks in time with the music — in which he reps for hip-hop culture has made him a made man in wrestling. \n\n\n\tThere’s been no group of people championing him louder than the hip-hop community — many rappers have been clamoring to come to the ring with him, just as Wayne did, as have Travis Scott and Migos veteran Quavo.\n\n\n\t“When the lights come on, it’s go time with Travis,” Jey says. “He gets what we’re doing — he’s giving back to wrestling. Now he’s involved with the Rock and John Cena —would you have ever thought that? No, bro.”\n\n\n\tHowever, he says he was as shocked as anyone when Scott viciously punched Universal Champion Cody Rhodes as he lay defenseless on the mat earlier this year, after he joined the Rock and Cena in the ring.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t“He smacked the hell of out of him,” Jey says. “That made me mad for some reason. Somebody gonna have to get Travis Scott.”\n\n\n\tKiller Mike tells Variety, “We’re used to only seeing hip-hop caricatures in wrestling — corny raps, exaggerated tropes like the boom box on the shoulder, crazy colors and fashions, butchered catch-phrases, and so on. With Jey, iit’s clear he was raised in the culture, so it’s genuine and not a gimmick. And that’s what why we fuck with him.”\n\n\n\tThat major pivot, marked the career changing shift in Jey in which he’s reaping the benefits of today.  During the pandemic, WWE started crafting the most successful storyline in history, The Bloodline saga. It involved Jey and his brother Jimmy as well as their real-life cousin Roman Reigns who they grew up with. The Bloodlines run deep indeed. In addition to all being cousins of The Rock, Jey and Jimmy are the sons of WWE Hall of Famer Rikishi, while Roman’s dad is a WWE Hall of Fame inductee as well Sika, of the legendary tag team The Wild Samoans.\n\n\n\tDuring the pandemic, Roman started his most dominate run: A game-changing era as champion that lasted 1,316 days and anchored WWE to their most profitable time ever. By his side, the Uso brothers became the longest running tag team champions ever, holding the belts for close to 700 days.\n\n\n\t“It was easy for me and Roman to get real on each other because we’re family,” Jey says. “Same as my brother. It was real easy for me to tap into that because it’ll just come out. People felt that.”\n\n\n\tAfter a complicated drama familiar to WWE, Jimmy Uso betrayed his brother and cost him the Universal title in a match last year where he was challenging Roman. Months later, Jimmy cost Jey the Intercontinental title, thus setting up their match at Mania 40.\n\n\n\t“I was just thinking ‘I gotta elevate now,’ Jey says. “I came with all these new colors [in my outfits], new music, the ‘Yeet movement.’”\n\n\n\tJey’s biggest win to date happened in February, when he won the 30 Man Royal Rumble match, which has been a career defining feat reserved for upper echelon superstars: The Rock, Hulk Hogan, John Cena, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels are previous winners. Jey won by being the last man standing and eliminating John Cena. With the victory, Jey earned an automatic spot at WrestleMania to fight the champion of his choice.  \n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAs Saturday’s night one of WrestleMania 41 is right upon us, Jey finds himself poised to be step up and get the entire package together. He has the popularity, the merch sales, the props from celebrities — but the one thing that has eluded is the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\n\n\tSaturday night, he faces the villainous Gunther, who has been the bane of Jey’s existence, besting him in two previous matches and sneak-attacking him for weeks on Monday Night Raw. Gunther even brutalized Jimmy while Jay was strapped to a ring rope, unable to assist his brother. Gunther left Jimmy leaking from his head and wiped the blood on his chest and even tasted it. This latest development has added even more fuel to the fire in their feud.\n\n\n\t“I gotta test my gangster against him,” Jey says of Gunther. “I’m ready, though. I gotta beat Gunter to solidify my thing. It’s my turn now.”\n\n\nJey Uso Vs Gunther will be the first match of WrestleMania Weekend as night one kicks off on Saturday 7 p.m. ET.  ",
