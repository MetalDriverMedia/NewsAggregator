The Baatara Gorge Waterfall drops through the Three Bridges Chasm. At the bottom, the water falls into a cave system and reemerges in the Dalleh Spring nearly four miles away.\n\nThe hole and cave were formed by the rock's Upper Jurassic limestone reacting with weak acids naturally occurring in rainwater, causing erosion. Freezing winter temperatures also caused the rocks on chasm's walls to break off, widening the hole.\n\nTwo natural bridges overlook the waterfall, as well as one at the ground level, giving the chasm its name. Despite its astonishing beauty, the Baatara Gorge Waterfall is little-known internationally. It was not known outside Lebanon until French speleologist Henri Coiffait visited the site in 1952. The hole's location was added to maps starting in the 1980s.\n\nThe waterfall is free and open to the public at all hours. The best time to visit is between April and June when the waters are flowing. \n\n\n                      April 16, 2025\n                    \n\nInside a former smuggler's cave, an artificial waterfall and light show.\n\nIn the Ozarks, a waterfall shoots out from a glorious hole.\n\nSouth of Bologna, a limestone grotto with a protruding waterfall and a floor full of cave pearls.\n\nA natural swimming pool in the middle of the Carite Forest.\n\nThe waters of these secluded falls are said to have healing powers.\n\nA waterfall and cave near Arroyo Seco that inspired the writings of D.

    "body": "Mango skin is packed with fiber and contains polyphenols, vitamin C, and vitamin E. However, as it has a tough and leathery texture that's tricky to chew, it's commonly removed. The skin of this tropical stone fruit can actually be used to make herbal teas, Indian pickles, or sweet chutneys, so it's generally safe to eat. Having said that, there's one thing you need to be aware of before you try making up a homemade batch of mango achar; in some cases mango skin can cause a rash in those who have a sensitivity to a substance called urushiol.\n\nUrushiol is an allergenic oily resin that's found in mango skin, plants such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, and the shells of pistachio nuts and cashews. If you've ever had poison ivy, you'll be familiar with the itchy rash it can induce on the skin. In some cases, those who've been exposed to urushiol in the past can experience a hypersensitization to mango too and develop unwanted side effects, such as itching, redness, and swelling around the mouth and face. If you've developed a mango allergy it can be treated with antihistamines and topical creams to reduce the itchiness and combat the swelling. Bear in mind that in the majority of instances, mango skin doesn't cause side effects. But if you've had a severe rash from exposure to poison oak or something similar in the past then you may want to avoid it just in case.\n\nA good tip is to always wash mangoes well before slicing them or chopping the flesh into pieces. This won't get rid of the urushiol but it can help to remove any pesticide residues that are on the surface and is a vital step if you prepare your mangoes by slicing them straight down the sides (avoiding the large stone in the middle) and scraping the flesh directly off the skin by dragging your teeth along it.\n\nSome say that the proper way to slice a mango is to remove the peel first, which would reduce the risk of coming into contact with the allergens in the fibrous skin upon eating. However, you can also slice it with the skin on and make a scored crisscross pattern in the flesh before turning it inside out to create little cubes you can eat with a spoon or use in a zingy mango salsa.\n\nIf you're keen to minimize food waste in the kitchen, consider eating the skins of other fruits that are safe to eat, such as watermelon rind. One of the best ways to eat watermelon rind is to pickle it with spices or saute it in a skillet until it softens. You can even make a zero-waste curry with leftover banana peels and prepare candied citrus with the pith and peel of oranges, lemons, and limes.",

    "body": "An overripe heirloom tomato hates to see a Zwilling chef’s knife coming — and they’re up to 50% off \n\nIf you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy.\n\nWhen it comes to essential kitchen tools, there are wants and then there are needs; I may want these Wolverine-esque meat shredders, but I need a high-quality chef’s knife in my life. Everything from overripe tomatoes to acorn squash become finger hazards when I settle for a dull blade, but thankfully, there are many brands out there making quality, super-sharp knives, from newcomers like Material Kitchen to trustworthy legacy brands like Zwilling. So, great news: Right now, Zwilling is offering up to 50 percent off a selection of its iconic German-made knives. \n\nFor Zwilling newcomers, the brand is one of the most famous blade-slingers in the industry, renowned for its high-quality, durable German-made blades. Now, whether or not German knives are superior to Japanese blades is a heated Reddit topic, and one that more or less comes down to preference, but, as one subreddit user explains, German blades are generally thicker and more curved, and require a little less blade maintenance to upkeep. Japanese blades are typically made of high-carbon steel, which can be incredibly durable but more prone to chipping than a German blade, which tends to be made out of a slightly softer stainless steel. Personally, I love the satisfying thunk of a German blade chopping a giant onion; Ina Garten, too, famously prefers a German-made blade (her go-to is from the comparable, albeit pricier Wüsthof) when it comes to her kitchen workhorse knives. \n\nI picked the best selection of knives on sale at Zwilling right now, which includes everything from 19-piece knife sets that are $200 off to a versatile, 8-inch chef’s knife on sale for under $100. \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\nOops.

Are you more of a take-out person than a home-cooked meal fan? We get it. Sometimes you just need the convenience of someone else doing all the cooking. And if you're in a last-minute panic over what to serve guests, ordering from your favorite restaurant can be a true lifesaver. But you know what's even better? Scoring an amazing deal while you're at it. Luckily for you, there are plenty of places that are more than hoppy to offer up discounts and special meals just for Easter weekend. Here's what we're eyeing.\n\nFrom now until April 20, Amazon Fresh (open on Easter Sunday) is offering up multiple options for Easter meals and steals. The company has an Easter Dinner For 10 option for just $40 that includes a spiral ham, asparagus, carrots, potato sides, rolls, and cupcakes, as well as Easter Brunch For 6, which comes with smoked salmon, bacon, bagels, donuts, croissants, pancakes, quiche, raspberries, blackberries, syrup, cream cheese, and orange juice. You can also stock up on Easter basket essentials, as well as tulips, all for under $10.\n\nFrom now through April 22, shoppers with Amazon Prime can score a large handful of discounts from the grocery chain, including 30% off Bone-In Spiral-Cut Pork Ham, 20% off Grass-Fed Bone-In Leg of Lamb, 20% off Sustainable Wild Caught Fresh Halibut Fillets, and 30% off select brunch items like Bob's Red Mill and Simply Organic. \n\nIf you don't want to grab takeout, but also don't feel like cooking, you can head to your local Maggiano's on Easter. Families of four or more dining at the restaurant can enjoy a family-style meal with options such as Rigatoni Alla Vodka, Wagyu Beef Meatballs, and Tiramisu. \n\nBWW has officially dubbed April the \"month of free.\" Rewards members can score a free burger with a minimum order of $15 or free delivery on orders of $30 or more; 10 free boneless wings with a $20 purchase; 6 free boneless wings with a $15 order; and a free sandwich when you spend $15. \n\nLooking for a last-minute treat to fill your Easter baskets? On Easter Sunday, Gopuff customers can snag 20% off Tony's Chocolonely and Free2b. Plus, if you happen to be a FAM member, you can also purchase a dozen organic eggs for just $2–a total steal these days. \n\nApplebee's just brought back its fan-fave 2-for $25 menu just in time for Easter celebration and introduced two all-new menu items: the Sizzlin' Skillets and 6-ounce Top Sirloin steak. For that under-$30 price tag, you can pair any two items with your choice of appetizer or two side salads.\n\nEaster is the perfect excuse for a sugar rush. Fortunately, Baskin-Robbins has savings on frozen beverages for the entire month of April. Through the 30th, you can score a $5 small drink, $6 medium, or $7 large. \n\nPlus, if you're planning to pick up the Rosie the Bunny cake or the Petal Pop Cake for your celebration, you can score $5 off until that same deadline. \n\nStart Easter Sunday right with a $5 House Bloody Mary special. \n\nKrispy Kreme is releasing its latest seasonal donut collection—and it could not be any cuter for Easter. The lineup includes a festive Bunny Basket, Marshmallow Bunny, and Bouncing Bunny doughnuts. As part of the celebration, you can also score a free Original Glazed dozen when you buy any dozen or 16-count selection on the menu.  \n\nThe week of easter, White Castle is offering fans a $6 Cheesy Cravings Meal with four cheese sliders, a small crinkle-cut fry, three cheese sticks, and a small drink. The deal ends the following week on April 22.  \n\nShake Shack is extending its Tax Day celebration through Easter and beyond. The chain is giving away free single Black Truffle Burgers, Black Truffle 'Shroom or Black Truffle Parmesan fries with any purchase of $10.40 or more through April 27.\n\nForget cooking. This year, pick up Target's Easter Meal for just $25 and call it homemade. It includes even more than years prior—including pineapple slices and Good & Gather French-Fried Onions—but at the same affordable price.   \n\n7-Eleven has quite the lineup of food deals this year. Stock up on Easter candy thanks to the chain's buy one, get one for $1 deal on all of the holiday's best sweets, including Nerds Easter Gummy Clusters, Nerds Rope, and Brach's jellybeans, as well as Reese's, Kit Kat, and Twix. \n\nThey're also hosting a delivery deal through the 7Now app that gets you $20 off orders of $30 or more on April 20th only. Use code EASTER.\n\nSpend $30 in Auntie Anne's or Cinnabon gift cards and you'll get an additional $5 gift card from both.  \n\nSpruce up your Easter dessert table with Baked by Melissa. When you bundle the Spring Fling 25-Pack with four Hoppy Treat 6-packs, you'll save 25%. The deal is valid through April 26. \n\nMegan Schaltegger is an NYC-based writer. She loves strong coffee, eating her way through the Manhattan food scene, and her dog, Murray. She promises not to talk about herself in third person IRL.\n\nWe may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n\n©2025 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

Here's my advice after using this next-gen router for a week\n\nReports first began around 3:15 p.m. E.T. and quickly escalated. The outage tracking website DownDetector showed nearly 60,000 reports around 3:30 p.m. E.T. Reports were declining by 4 p.m., but that could just be because people no longer feel the need to report the outage. \n\nThe Zoom status page acknowledged the problem quickly, posting around 10 minutes later that it was \"investigating domain name resolution issues\" that were affecting multiple services. \n\nThe problem seemed to quickly worsen though, as the Zoom website was down earlier, including the status page.

    "body": "Swapping large language models (LLMs) is supposed to be easy, isn’t it? After all, if they all speak “natural language,” switching from GPT-4o to Claude or Gemini should be as simple as changing an API key… right?\n\nIn reality, each model interprets and responds to prompts differently, making the transition anything but seamless. Enterprise teams who treat model switching as a “plug-and-play” operation often grapple with unexpected regressions: broken outputs, ballooning token costs or shifts in reasoning quality.\n\nThis story explores the hidden complexities of cross-model migration, from tokenizer quirks and formatting preferences to response structures and context window performance. Based on hands-on comparisons and real-world tests, this guide unpacks what happens when you switch from OpenAI to Anthropic or Google’s Gemini and what your team needs to watch for.\n\nEach AI model family has its own strengths and limitations. Some key aspects to consider include:\n\nImagine a real-world scenario where you’ve just benchmarked GPT-4o, and now your CTO wants to try Claude 3.5. Make sure to refer to the pointers below before making any decision:\n\nAll model providers pitch extremely competitive per-token costs. For example, this post shows how the tokenization costs for GPT-4 plummeted in just one year between 2023 and 2024. However, from a machine learning (ML) practitioner’s viewpoint, making model choices and decisions based on purported per-token costs can often be misleading. \n\nA practical case study comparing GPT-4o and Sonnet 3.5 exposes the verbosity of Anthropic models’ tokenizers. In other words, the Anthropic tokenizer tends to break down the same text input into more tokens than OpenAI’s tokenizer. \n\nEach model provider is pushing the boundaries to allow longer and longer input text prompts. However, different models may handle different prompt lengths differently. For example, Sonnet-3.5 offers a larger context window up to 200K tokens as compared to the 128K context window of GPT-4. Despite this, it is noticed that OpenAI’s GPT-4 is the most performant in handling contexts up to 32K, whereas Sonnet-3.5’s performance declines with increased prompts longer than 8K-16K tokens.\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that different context lengths are treated differently within intra-family models by the LLM, i.e., better performance at short contexts and worse performance at longer contexts for the same given task. This means that replacing one model with another (either from the same or a different family) might result in unexpected performance deviations.\n\nUnfortunately, even the current state-of-the-art LLMs are highly sensitive to minor prompt formatting. This means the presence or absence of formatting in the form of markdown and XML tags can highly vary the model performance on a given task.\n\nEmpirical results across multiple studies suggest that OpenAI models prefer markdownified prompts including sectional delimiters, emphasis, lists, etc. In contrast, Anthropic models prefer XML tags for delineating different parts of the input prompt. This nuance is commonly known to data scientists and there is ample discussion on the same in public forums (Has anyone found that  using markdown in the prompt makes a difference?, Formatting plain text to markdown, Use XML tags to structure your prompts).\n\nFor more insights, check out the official best prompt engineering practices released by OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively.  \n\nOpenAI GPT-4o models are generally biased toward generating JSON-structured outputs. However, Anthropic models tend to adhere equally to the requested JSON or XML schema, as specified in the user prompt.However, imposing or relaxing the structures on models’ outputs is a model-dependent and empirically driven decision based on the underlying task. During a model migration phase, modifying the expected output structure would also entail slight adjustments in the post-processing of the generated responses.\n\nLLM switching is more complicated than it looks. Recognizing the challenge, major enterprises are increasingly focusing on providing solutions to tackle it. Companies like Google (Vertex AI), Microsoft (Azure AI Studio) and AWS (Bedrock) are actively investing in tools to support flexible model orchestration and robust prompt management.\n\nFor example, Google Cloud Next 2025 recently announced that Vertex AI allows users to work with more than 130 models by facilitating an expanded model garden, unified API access, and the new feature AutoSxS, which enables head-to-head comparisons of different model outputs by providing detailed insights into why one model’s output is better than the other.\n\nMigrating prompts across AI model families requires careful planning, testing and iteration. By understanding the nuances of each model and refining prompts accordingly, developers can ensure a smooth transition while maintaining output quality and efficiency.\n\nML practitioners must invest in robust evaluation frameworks, maintain documentation of model behaviors and collaborate closely with product teams to ensure the model outputs align with end-user expectations. Ultimately, standardizing and formalizing the model and prompt migration methodologies will equip teams to future-proof their applications, leverage best-in-class models as they emerge, and deliver users more reliable, context-aware, and cost-efficient AI experiences.\n\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "body": "The Global Engagement Center, a State Department unit that called out Russian and Chinese propaganda campaigns and became a MAGA boogeyman, has been shut down. Team Trump is promising that it’s just the start of an examination of alleged censorship during the Biden administration—and the first Trump administration too.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio called the move “a crucial step toward keeping the president’s promise to liberate American speech” in an op-ed for the right-wing site The Federalist. Critics say it’s part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to withdraw from a decades-long contest of ideas and information with America’s adversaries.\n\nIn early February, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded the Justice Department task force on covert foreign influence and radically narrowed enforcement of the law that outlawed secretive propaganda for overseas regimes. The Trump administration gutted the parent organization of the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Free Asia, which aimed to provide news and demonstrate the value of a free press in regions of the world where both were often in short supply. Together, according to The Washington Post, they reached a weekly audience of 420 million people in 63 languages. “Most shameful moment at the department since the purges of the 1950s,” one State Department official, who was granted anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to the press, tells WIRED.\n\nTo Trumpists, the push to publish American-style news around the world was an outdated waste of taxpayer money, and attempts to combat disinformation abroad, even if their origins were benign, were really attempts to silence right-wing Americans. The Global Engagement Center, or GEC, became a particular fixation. “The worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation is an obscure agency called GEC,” Elon Musk posted in 2023. (MIT Technology Review first reported the news of its closure.)\n\n(“The allegations of ‘censorship’ against the GEC are as fictitious as the conspiracy theories spun by various bad-faith actors around international broadcasting and other long-standing institutions of American soft power now under attack,” said the State Department official.)\n\nFirst established during the war on terror to counter and keep tabs on militant messaging overseas, the GEC expanded over the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations into a $60-million, 120-person shop which also tracked and exposed rival nation-state campaigns to spread propaganda and pollute the information environment. It mapped a multibillion-dollar Chinese influence program that stretched from Pakistan to Latin America. It looked into the social media accounts boosting Germany’s far-right AfD party and spreading neo-Nazi propaganda. It revealed a covert Russian effort to undermine public health in Africa. And the GEC called out the Kremlin’s claims that the “United States worked with Ukraine to train an army of migratory birds, mosquitos, and even bats to carry biological weapons into Russia.”\n\nSometimes, with grants of just a few thousand dollars, it funded the work of journalists in countries targeted by the Putin regime. “We were really focused on building the capacity of folks that were already doing that good work and making sure that they had the platform to continue to tell their stories—to tell the truth in an environment that was trying to take that from them,” a second State Department source tells WIRED.\n\nOver the years, the GEC’s effectiveness and execution were questioned by the State Department’s Inspector General, among others. But the GEC and efforts like it generally received bipartisan support. That started to change after the pandemic—and Musk’s purchase of Twitter. The so-called “Twitter Files”—reports based on Musk’s release of internal company emails—seemed to show the GEC being far too aggressive in its attempts to tamp down on alleged Covid disinformation during Trump’s first term. Republican critics like US Representative Brian Mast of Florida complained that the GEC wasn’t being aggressive enough in support of Israel after October 7. Other GOP congresspersons zeroed in on its $100,000 grant to the UK-based Global Disinformation Index to monitor media in Asia. The Index later compiled a list of the 10 American news outlets at highest risk of publishing false claims; nearly all of them were MAGA-friendly. This was an entirely separate project from the one the GEC funded, but Trumpists saw the existence of the list as evidence that it was suppressing speech at home when it was supposed to be looking abroad.\n\n“GEC’s history shows the pernicious way Washington turns laudable public goals into a means of entrenching its own power and rolling back the freedom of regular Americans,” Rubio wrote in his op-ed. “Over the past half-decade, bodies like GEC, crafted by our own governing ruling class, nearly destroyed America’s long free speech history. The enemies of speech had new lingo to justify their authoritarian impulse. It was ‘disinformation,’ allegedly pushed by nefarious foreign governments, that was the No. 1 threat to ‘our democracy.’ To protect ‘our democracy,’ this ‘disinformation’ had to be identified and stamped out.”\n\nA famously conservative US court of appeals rejected this idea, writing that “there is no indication that State Department officials flagged specific content for censorship.” But by then, the GEC was poison in MAGA minds. Its participation in a State Department campaign accusing Kremlin-funded media outlet RT of being an intelligence operation did not change their opinions. The GEC was cleared of “having anything to do with domestic suppression of points of view. But what was going on was that they decided that this was a winnable, small victory they could have over this ‘liberal institution,’” according to a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nA December deal to reauthorize funding for the GEC, due to run out in 2024, fell apart after “Elon Musk got involved,” that source said; the center was officially disbanded, but about 50 staffers and $30 million in funding were moved to a “Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub” in the hopes of proving the value of such an operation to their new MAGA superiors. They were also given a new boss, Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Darren Beattie.\n\nThe name may sound familiar. Beattie had left a trail of trolly posts on Musk’s social media platform—promoting the Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, for instance, and musing that “competent white men must be in charge if you want things to work.” He also called his future boss Marco Rubio “low IQ.”\n\nRubio, until recently, was hawkish about fighting foreign influence campaigns. In 2023, a second diplomatic source with direct knowledge said, he supported reauthorizing funding the GEC into the 2030s. “It’s not just Russia—Iran, China, North Korea, and even Cuba are pushing disinformation into America,” he posted last September. But after being confirmed as secretary of state, Rubio appeared to do something of a 180. While the department would continue to counter “enemy propaganda,” he wrote in a cable, any State Department programs that “lead or in any way open the door to censorship of the American people will be terminated.”\n\n“The secretary believes shutting down GEC was long overdue,” a State spokesperson tells WIRED. “It cost taxpayers $50 million a year, and the Biden administration used that money to silence and censor Americans. What started out years ago as an effort to counter terrorist organizations was exploited by partisan bureaucrats who used the office to go after Americans’ free speech. Even career employees acknowledged GEC’s ambiguous mission was always problematic. Thanks to Secretary Rubio, the American people won’t have to worry about it anymore, as it has been permanently disbanded.”\n\nFor the first 60 days, the renamed, pared-down Global Engagement Center escaped the clear-cutting that took down the US Agency for International Development and other programs boosting America’s standing abroad. But employees there knew that this was, at best, a temporary stay of execution. In his Federalist op-ed, Rubio wrote, “Today, we are putting that to an end. Whatever name it goes by, GEC is dead. It will not return.”\n\nStories about GEC will continue, Rubio promised in a livestreamed conversation with Mike Benz, a former State Department official who has both a well-documented animus toward foreign-assistance and counter-disinformation programs—as well as a long history of promoting outlandish conspiracy theories.\n\nBenz asked Rubio if there would be a kind of Twitter Files sequel, this time for GEC. “Yeah. So I think what we have to do now, and Darren [Beattie] will be involved in that as well, is sort of document what happened,” Rubio answered.\n\nThe secretary of state promised an even further-reaching, “cross-jurisdictional” effort to look at who got “deplatformed” for peddling disinformation or foreign propaganda and whether the US government could be blamed for it. “If we could somehow, with an internal review, create a linkage between some information that came from something the State Department paid for and an actual aggrieved party, that's what's important,” Rubio said.\n\nIn your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AI\n\nBig Story: If Anthropic succeeds, a nation of benevolent AI geniuses could be born\n\nScientists claim to have brought back the dire wolf\n\nSpecial Edition: The most dangerous hackers you’ve never heard of\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

    "body": "\nUPDATE: Apr. 16, 2025, 5:35 p.m. EDT This article has been updated to include the official streaming release of \"The Brutalist,\" as well as the latest pricing details.\n\n\nIf you haven't seen The Brutalist yet, you can now watch all three-and-a-half hours of it at home from your couch — where you have the ability to pause and return to it as you see fit. Mashable's reviewer Siddhant Adlakha called it a \"modern American masterpiece,\" and we named it one of the best films of 2024.\n\nSet in the aftermath of World War II, director Brady Corbet crafts a deeply moving film about immigrants, architecture, and Jewish identity. It stars Adrien Brody — who nabbed not only the Golden Globe, but also the Academy Award for his role as László Tóth — as well as Felicity Jones, Guy Pearce, and Raffey Cassidy. It was one of the most nominated films at the 2025 Academy Awards, and managed to take home three, including Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, and Best Lead Actor.\n\nYou can watch it for yourself at home now that it's officially available at digital-on-demand retailers and will soon make its streaming debut. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nClocking in at three-and-a-half hours long, The Brutalist tells the tale of László Tóth (Brody), a fictitious Jewish Hungarian architect and survivor of the Holocaust, over several decades as he arrives in America post-World War II. \"It embodies the kind of American epics no longer really made by Hollywood studios. All the while, the film also explores the fraught corners of post-World War II Jewish identity in the West,\" Adlakha writes.\n\nThe Brutalist clocked in at No. 17 on our list of the best films of 2024. It was also one of the most prominently featured films this awards season. It nabbed the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for Brody, and Best Director for Corbet. Additionally, it earned 10 Oscars nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, and Supporting Actress. While it was a favorite to take home the biggest award of the night, it ended up losing out to Anora. Still, it took home the prize in Best Lead Actor, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.\n\nCurrently, the A24 film has a 93 percent critic rating and an 80 percent audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Mashable's own reviewer writes, \"The Brutalist is a towering paean to the American dream, in all its force and folly. Set over several decades, Brady Corbet's post-World War II immigrant saga is — like the architectural achievements of its protagonist — constructed with meticulous consideration, resulting in a work of multifaceted technique and piercing humanity.\"\n\nThere are multiple ways to watch The Brutalist at home: purchasing it via digital video-on-demand, renting it through digital video-on-demand, and of course, streaming. The cheapest option is renting, but it's also the most limiting.\n\nThe Brutalist made its digital debut just shy of two months after its theatrical release. You can purchase the film for your digital collection as of Feb. 18 at online retailers like Prime Video and Apple TV. It's also available to rent at the same digital retailers for 30 days. Just note that once you start watching, you'll only have 48 hours to finish — and it's a 3.5-hour movie.\n\nHere are some quick links to rent or purchase the A24 flick:\n\nFandango at Home (Vudu) — buy it for $19.99, rent it for $5.99\n\nThanks to a multi-year output deal between A24 and Warner Bros. Discovery, we knew that The Brutalist would eventually make its streaming debut on Max alongside other recent A24 hits like Babygirl and Queer. The usual window between a digital and streaming release for A24 is about around two-and-a-half months, so we originally thought it would start streaming at the end of April. A24, instead, decided to make us wait a little longer. The Brutalist is finally set to make its streaming debut on Max on May 16.\n\nMax subscriptions start at $9.99 per month, but there are a few ways to save money on your plan. We've rounded up the best Max streaming deals for you below.\n\nWhile a Max with ads subscription goes for $9.99 per month, you can knock that price down to just $8.33 per month by signing up for a year in advance. Yes, you'll have to pay $99.99 upfront, but the breakdown monthly ends up saving you 16%. \n\nBetter yet, if you sign up before May 7, you'll be able to slash that price even further as annual subscriptions are 20% off their usual cost. That drops the annual plan with ads down to only $79.99 per year or $6.67 broken down monthly. After your initial discounted year is up, the price will revert back to the typical annual plan fee, which is still a very good price.\n\nSimilarly, for those who hate ads, you can also save up to 32% through May 7 by committing to a yearly plan of the Max ad-free tiers. You have two tiers to choose from: Max Ad-Free and Max Ultimate Ad-Free. The basic ad-free tier costs either $16.99 per month or $139.99 per year (about $11.67 per month) for a limited time, while the Ultimate tier costs either $20.99 per month or $169.99 per year (about $14.17 per month) for a limited time. The price drop is only valid for your first year of streaming and will revert back to full cost — $169.99 or $209.99 per year — thereafter.\n\nNote: Both tiers offer an ad-free viewing experience, but the Ultimate tier comes with 4K Ultra HD video quality and Dolby Atmos immersive audio.\n\nCricket customers on the $60 per month unlimited plan get a free Max with ads subscription — no questions asked. That's a $99.99 per year value for zero dollars. If you're already on the $60 per month unlimited plan, just head over to the Max app, choose Cricket as your provider, then enter your Cricket credentials to log in. Boom — you're free to watch whatever you want, whenever you want — including The Brutalist upon its release. Check out the terms and conditions on Cricket's website to learn more.\n\nAnother way you can get Max for free in 2025 is through DoorDash's annual DashPass plan. A yearly DashPass membership costs $96 per year ($8 per month) and gets you $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders, as well as a Max subscription with ads. You'll just have to activate your Max subscription through your DoorDash account. Then, once you're in, you're in as long as your annual DashPass plan is valid.\n\nCollege students can get an entire year of Max with ads for just $4.99 per month instead of $9.99. That's 50% in savings. All you have to do is verify your student status with UNiDAYS to retrieve the unique discount code that will drop the price.\n\nWhile it won't be the cheapest way to get Max, you can get more bang for your buck if you choose a streaming bundle deal instead of a single service. For only $16.99 per month (reg. $25.97), you can sign up for Max, Hulu, and Disney+ with ads or $29.99 per month (reg. $48.97) without ads. That's up to 38% in savings for access to three full streaming libraries.\n\nMax is the streaming home for Warner Bros. as well as new A24 theatrical releases, which means you can watch a slew of hit films, including Civil War, Love Lies Bleeding, Dune, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Barbie, Elvis, Priscilla, Midsommar, The Iron Claw, and Dicks: The Musical.\n\nMax also has its own original series that are definitely worth watching, like True Detective, Barry, Succession, The Last of Us, and Station Eleven, among many others. For more recommendations, check out our watch guides for the best movies on Max, best '90s movies on Max, best horror movies on Max, best TV comedies on Max, best true crime documentaries on Max, best mini-series on Max, and best rom-coms on Max.\n\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment.

But the company has changed its mind and is now making it available for free.\n\n“We’ve been hearing great feedback on Gemini Live with camera and screen share, so we decided to bring it to more people,” Google said on X.\n\nThe feature will roll out to all Android users with the Gemini app starting today, and the rollout will take place “over the coming weeks.” If you want to get an idea of how the feature works, check out this video from Google. In it, a person holds their phone with the camera open at an aquarium so that Gemini can see the animals and share information.\n\nToday, Microsoft announced that its similar AI tool, called Copilot Vision, is available now for free in the Edge browser.\n\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.",

The Premier League announced that it was removing the midseason break in order to accommodate a mid-August start to the season to meet the goal of giving all players three full weeks off during the summer. \n\n“This takes into account expert advice from medical and technical departments, which values a longer period of complete rest in the summer rather than a short break in the winter,” according to the Premier League website.\n\nEvery single game will be available to watch live across NBC’s platforms. Full details below. \n\nThe opening day of the season was on Friday, August 16, 2024. \n\nChampionship Sunday will take place on Sunday, May 25, 2025, with all 10 games kicking off at the same time, 11am ET. \n\nAll 20 teams play 38 games each, 19 home and 19 away. That equals 380 total Premier League games during the 2024-25 season. \n\nLeicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton were promoted to the Premier League for the 2024-25 season.

    "body": "NEW YORK -- Brooklyn Nets forward Trendon Watford is heading into an important summer for his career given that he is hitting unrestricted free-agency after coming off another solid season for the Nets. Watford had the best season of his career in Brooklyn so he could stand to come back to the team that gave him more responsibilities, but he is also looking to get his worth in free-agency.\n\n\"Obviously, you want to get what you feel like you deserve. Just having a consistent role these past two years, I think I've been able to show, not only my organization, but other organizations, putting my name out there, and earn respect on my name,\" Watford said during his exit interview on Monday. Watford heads into free-agency for the second time in as many season and this time around, he is entering the open market with a better resume.\n\n\"I think I've been able to do that with the opportunity that I've been given here,\" Watford continued. \"I think this is my second time coming around free agency. I know how it goes, and I know it's a business, but I enjoyed this. I enjoyed the group, and I enjoy being here. I know we gotta have some talks or whatever coming up soon. But, I enjoy being here. I like what we got going on.\"\n\nWatford, 24, is coming off the best season of his career as he averaged 10.2 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game while shooting 46.9% from the field and 33.0% from three-point range. Not only did Watford put up better numbers than he did last season, but he was also tasked with being more of a creator for himself and others as evidenced by his usage rate increasing from 21.1% last season to 23.3% this year.\n\nWatford also saw more playing time this season as he averaged a career-high 20.8 minutes per game, but this campaign also came with him dealing with injuries causing him to play in just 44 games, the lowest games played figure in a season for him. However, with all of that in mind heading into the offseason, Watford is happy to have made it on the other side of those injuries as he learned many lessons along the way.\n\n\"Just with injuries and stuff, just taking my time and trusting my body, and just being professional about my body. Just taking time with that, I think just dealing with the hamstring injury that I had, obviously just doing it twice. It was just tough at first, but I just got through it. And, just (my) mental toughness,\" Watford explained. The Nets are expected to have the most cap space available this summer so Watford could be back in Brooklyn with a new mindset towards remaining healthy and maximizing his opportunities.",

    "body": "On April 10, former Texas wide receiver and NFL draft prospect Isaiah Bond turned himself into Frisco, Texas, police on an outstanding sexual assault warrant. He subsequently posted $25,000 bond and was released from custody.\n\nLess than a week later, Bond has filed a lawsuit against his accuser in a Texas federal court, per NFL Media. His agent, Damien Butler, sent an email to all 32 NFL teams, insisting that Bond is innocent.\n\n\"Unlike the false narrative that has been amplified, the truth, once revealed in its entirety, will show that he was targeted by a woman eight years his senior, relentlessly pursued, enticed by explicit photos & videos and ultimately setup for financial gain.\n\n\"Isaiah, like most 21-year-olds, must show a higher level of discernment in social media interactions and access, however, he is completely innocent of the allegations levied against him and will fight to clear his name.  For Clubs that still feel his elite talent can help them win games for the next decade, he is eager to get back on the gridiron where he feels most at home.\"\n\nThe lawsuit comes after WFAA.com obtained the affidavit from the accuser that sheds more light on the allegations.\n\nThe alleged victim claimed that Bond sent her a direct message on Instagram and then they began texting. Their text conversations then turned to \"mutual discussions of having sex and engaging in one act in particular, which the victim said she would consider.\n\nThe alleged victim said they met on Feb. 4 and said it began as a consensual sexual encounter until Bond allegedly \"brought up the notion of the act they'd previously discussed in their text exchanges.\" She allegedly said she \"was not comfortable trying it\" but claims he \"began engaging in that act anyway.\"\n\nThe affidavit states that the woman asked Bond to stop while physically pushing him away and telling him she was in pain, but Bond continued with the act and covered her month.\n\nBond allegedly said \"alcohol makes me do things\" and asked the alleged victim to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which she said she refused to do. The affidavit states that the alleged victim texted Bond after leaving, saying, \"Isaiah you were wrong for that I asked you to stop and you kept covering my mouth. I'm in a lot of pain.\"\n\nShe then claims he later offered a payment over text, saying Bond messaged her, \"You want a 1000 I'm really sorry!\" and, \"Would that make it feel better.\"\n\nOfficers met with the alleged victim on Feb. 20 and had her text Bond again in a \"pretextual interview.\" She asked him to apologize over text while meeting with the officers, to which he responded, \"I did.\"\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the alleged victim responded, \"apologizing by trying to pay me isn't a real apology Isaiah you really hurt me and I kept telling you to stop,\" to which Bond replied, \"I'm sorry.\" From there, the affidavit states she was unable to contact Bond. \n\nBond initially stated his innocence in the matter on April 10 when he released a statement via social media, calling the allegations \"patently false.\"\n\n\"Regarding the accusation made against me, I would appreciate the time and opportunity to defend myself and prove the claims made, patently false.  I am in full cooperation with the authorities and will remain a willing and active participant in the investigation.  Unfortunately, claims like these prove to be harmful to all involved, absent full review.  I kindly request that all reserve judgement until the authorities provide a complete report based on truth and evidence.\"\n\nBond played wide receiver at Texas last season after spending his first two years at Alabama. For his career, Bond totaled 99 catches for 1,428 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\n\r\nCBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

    "body": "Let's blow it up and start over. Let's have fun with a mock draft that's unlike all the others.\n\nImagine a scenario where, today, the NFL decides to reset the league. Using the current draft order (but snaking after the first round for competitive balance) and with zero dollars on everyone's books, the league allows teams to draft from the player pool, including veterans and draft-eligible rookies. Those players then arrive on their new clubs with their current contract terms. While the players move, the coaches and general managers remain in place. \n\nIn this exercise, NFL writers Henry McKenna and David Helman took turns picking for the franchises. And their overarching strategies were quite different. We decided to mock two rounds of what would be a 53-round draft. \n\nIt's a no-brainer. I'll take the once-in-a-generation talent who has already won three Super Bowls and appeared in five. — Henry McKenna\n\nYou really can't go wrong with either Allen or Lamar Jackson in this spot. I ultimately chose Allen because he just signed a new extension that will keep him under contract for two years longer than Lamar. That NFL MVP talent, combined with stability at the position, makes me more than happy to pull the trigger and bring elite quarterback play to Cleveland. — David Helman\n\nCould you imagine the smile on Brian Daboll's face? Lamar is the most dangerous dual-threat quarterback in the NFL. Sure, you have to customize your offense to suit Jackson. But that's one of the best problems you can have. Most teams dream of customizing an offense around a quarterback as special as Lamar. — McKenna\n\nThere are just four quarterbacks in the NFL right now who are clearly a cut above the rest, in my opinion. Burrow is the last of those four, so it's a no-brainer to take him here before the drop-off begins. We already know he can turn a franchise into a contender seemingly overnight, because that's exactly what he's done in Cincinnati. And he's still just 28 years old. — Helman\n\nIt's a risk to invest in a quarterback with just one year of NFL experience. But Daniels did what Caleb Williams and Drake Maye (and so many other rookie QBs) couldn't. The (former) Commanders quarterback lifted a downtrodden organization straight into the NFC Championship Game, and he picked up the Offensive Rookie of the Year award along with way. Most of all, I want a QB who can comport himself with excellence in the postseason. Daniels now has more playoff appearances as the next guy on this list — and more playoff wins. — McKenna\n\nPeople have a lot of opinions about Herbert, many of them negative. And that's fine. I understand he hasn't delivered his best football in the Chargers' biggest moments. But if you're building a football team from scratch, there just aren't many guys you're taking ahead of a 6-foot-6 super-mutant athlete with a rocket arm. Herbert just turned 27 in March and he's under contract until 2030. I'm very confident I can build a winning football team around a guy with this rare of a skill set. — Helman\n\nIt's a steal to get the Super Bowl-winning quarterback at this point in the draft. New York should be thrilled. Hurts' passing statistics might give some people pause. Why would I go for Hurts after he threw for just 18 touchdowns in the regular season? Hurts taught us all a lesson on the value of efficiency this season. With Saquon Barkley taking the reins of the offense, Hurts enjoyed his highest touchdown passing percentage (5%), his second-lowest interception percentage (1.4%) and his second-highest success rate (46.6%). With Hurts, you have to look past the counting stats. That's how Nick Sirianni and Howie Roseman saw Super Bowl success. Maybe that's how the Jets can. — McKenna\n\nI'm more than happy to let the non-ball-knowers cool on Stroud, if that's what they want to do. Strictly speaking, he did have a sophomore slump in Houston — but that had a hell of a lot more to do with Stroud's surroundings than his actual play. The guy is still immensely talented and wise beyond his years in terms of processing his duties at the position. His 24th birthday isn't until October, and he's still got three years remaining on his rookie deal. Honestly, maybe he should've gone higher than No. 8 overall. Either way, the Panthers will gladly correct their mistake from the top of the 2023 draft here in our 2025 re-draft. — Helman\n\nIt feels like Goff has been in this league forever, but he's 30 years old, with at least a half-decade of good football left in him. The fact that Sean McVay moved off Goff has given the QB a bad rap. I think that's led to a lot of overthinking around an outstanding QB. He's fresh off a season where he threw for 4,629 passing yards, 37 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Goff had the best offense in football, and he made the most of it. I also think that Goff has the intelligence and determination to keep improving, much like Tom Brady and Matthew Stafford did. Pocket passers can mature like fine wine. I'll bet that Goff will do just that. — McKenna\n\nWhat a fun twist of fate to watch the Packers' franchise quarterback get re-drafted to a city that hates him. Love's second season as a starter in Green Bay wasn't quite as impressive as his first, but he has still proven himself as a franchise quarterback with plenty of room to grow and develop. Working with a quality playcaller like Ben Johnson, I'm confident Love's trajectory would continue upward, and he's still just 26. — Helman\n\nIt took a while, but things have really clicked for Mayfield. After 2023, there was skepticism around Mayfield's rise, given the Bucs' receivers and the clout of former OC Dave Canales (now in Carolina). But there really can't be any lingering doubt around Mayfield. He excelled without Canales. Receiver Chris Godwin played just seven games and Mike Evans played 14. Mayfield motored on: 4,500 passing yards, 41 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. Tampa even made the playoffs. Mayfield is a legitimate field general with the moxy to lead a locker room. Heck yeah, I'll build an organization around him, particularly with Kyle Shanahan calling the plays. — McKenna\n\nI'm positive TV executives would be doing backflips over this development. Williams has some work to do on his pocket presence and timing, but he had a perfectly solid rookie season. By drafting a 23-year-old, dual-threat quarterback, the Cowboys would be getting a lot younger and a lot more explosive at the position. And while Brian Schottenheimer is unknown as a head coach, he has experience working with a wide array of talented quarterbacks, from Russell Wilson to Trevor Lawrence to Dak Prescott. Caleb as a Cowboy would be must-see TV, and it would give the franchise a shot at a high, high ceiling. — Helman\n\nHere's where the non-QBs proved too tempting to pass up. Outside of Mahomes, Garrett is the best football player in the world. I want that guy on my team. You might think: Garrett's too old! Look, it's football. He's 29. You can't guarantee any player's peak performance beyond their next game. But I think, with Garrett, we can expect three or four years as the best defender on the planet. I love it. — McKenna\n\nIt's not fair to Prescott that he fell this far, given that he was an All-Pro and an NFL MVP candidate just 18 months ago. But the bottom line is that he's turning 32, he's now playing on an enormous contract, and three of his past five seasons have been marred by injury. I still think he's a quarterback you could win a Super Bowl with, but the window for that to happen is getting smaller every day. — Helman\n\nLet's think about a quarterback for Atlanta in the next round and instead snag that quarterback's best friend. Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell gets all the credit for making the most out of Kirk Cousins and Sam Darnold. But what about JJ? He's the best receiver in the NFL. He's a kingmaker for quarterbacks. I'll take that guy, because the rest of the QBs have too many points of uncertainty. And I think Jefferson will help stabilize the signal-caller and, in turn, the organization. — McKenna\n\nOf the truly elite edge rushers in the NFL right now, Parsons is younger than the other guys by roughly two years, at least. You could argue he hasn't even entered his prime, and yet he has 52.5 career sacks and Pro Football Focus credits him with an average of 88 pressures per year. There isn't a better combination of youth, talent and production to build a defense around. And, as creative as head coach Jonathan Gannon is, I'm positive he could find a dozen different uses for a chess piece like Parsons.— Helman\n\nBack to the Bengals! It's our first player landing with his original franchise. An offense only needs to get the ball in Chase's hands. Behind the line of scrimmage. Deep downfield. It really doesn't matter where. That's good news for whoever is playing quarterback. They've got a threat who will create big plays from every spot on the field. — McKenna\n\nIt's obvious we're in the middle of a run on the best talent at the premium positions. If the best young receivers and the best young pass-rushers are off the board, then I'm looking for the best young tackle in football if I'm the Seahawks. Wirfs has played at an All-Pro level at both right and left tackle, and — sorry if I sound repetitive — he just turned 26 in January. The offensive line has been a problem in Seattle forever, but Wirfs is going to help change that. — Helman\n\nWhen I speak to evaluators around the NFL about Maye, I hear a lot of compliments that exceed what he put on paper. When I speak to the people around Maye, I hear a lot of dissatisfaction and desire for more. This is all to say that Maye's hype machine is getting ready for takeoff. I'm not sure people realize how much talent is bubbling under the surface. The average fan might not see Maye coming. But folks that are watching closely? They see him ascending quickly into the NFL's top 10 quarterbacks. — McKenna\n\nThe Broncos famously chose Jerry Jeudy over Lamb back in 2020, but they won't be making the same mistake twice. Lamb is a top-five receiver in the NFL right now, even though he's not the most explosive athlete in the league. He's a quarterback's best friend with his route running and ability to generate separation, so he'll make life easier for whichever quarterback winds up in Denver with him. — Helman\n\nSurtain, 25, is among the five best football players in the world. Dave and I have already made clear the importance of quarterbacks. (They've dominated this draft.) So I'm going to take the third-best quarterback stopper in the NFL. Surtain has a long runway in his career of eliminating threats in the passing game and making opponents win with their second-best option. I love the idea of my opponents fighting with their left hand for the next five years. — McKenna\n\n​​Jim Harbaugh is the type of coach to prioritize the lines. Sewell has a case to be the first offensive lineman taken, especially given his age. After four years in the league, he still doesn't turn 25 until October! We know he's one of the best right tackles in football, but he's plenty capable of making the switch to the left side if Harbaugh wanted him to do it. Either way, adding an absurdly young All-Pro tackle is smart drafting. — Helman\n\nIn 15 games over his rookie season, Nabers had 109 catches for 1,204 yards with seven touchdowns. His quarterbacks were Daniel Jones, Drew Lock, Tommy DeVito and Tim Boyle. (For what it's worth, Nabers also threw a pass.) If Nabers has shown he can produce at that level in a terrible situation, I can't wait to see what he can do with, at least, a starting-caliber QB. — McKenna\n\nHopefully, John Randle smiles when he sees this pick. Defensive tackle is not usually seen as a premium position, but it becomes one real quickly when you find a guy who can wreck games — and that's exactly what Carter is. He's only been in the league two years, but he's already one of the best defensive tackles in football and the central cog in the Eagles' championship defense. And the scary thing is, he's probably not done growing as a player. It's not fair to compare him to Aaron Donald, but he's capable of making a similar type of impact for years to come. — Helman\n\nSlater's one of the best tackles in the NFL, and he's just 26. And one of the biggest lessons from Super Bowl LIX was that you can't win a Super Bowl without a left tackle. The Chiefs tried and failed to patch it together without one. So, I'll lock Slater into the role for the next five years, at least. My quarterback will thank me. — McKenna\n\nIt'd be pretty shocking if Lawrence fell this far in a real-life re-draft. Yes, he has not lived up to the massive hype placed upon him in 2021. He's injury-prone, he turns the ball over too much and he's playing on a massive contract. I still don't think most NFL teams would care about that stuff if they had a chance to add a quarterback with such a unique skill set. Sean McVay would have to be elated to land a mobile quarterback with an arm like Lawrence's this late in the draft. — Helman\n\nThis guy has 2,778 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns in the last two seasons. He's 25 and probably the best possession receiver in the NFL. If I'm trying to make life easier for my QB (who obviously isn't going to be elite), then St. Brown is the ticket. He's a world-beater inside the numbers. — McKenna\n\nIt'd be way too fun to bring Crosby back to his home state to anchor Dan Campbell's defense. It's ironic, because the Lions already had a dominant left end from Michigan in Aidan Hutchinson, but Crosby is the more polished player — who also isn't coming off a massive injury. — Helman\n\nIt's hard to deny what Nix did in his rookie season. He completed 66.3% of his passes for 3,775 passing yards, 29 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He had a few bad games early, and people wrote him off. He surged late in the year, and people didn't give him credit because his coach is/was Sean Payton. But when the smog cleared around Nix, I saw a quarterback who took his team to the playoffs in Year 1 — and who improved remarkably over 17 games. He's not electric. But someday, he could be exciting. And in the meantime, he appears to understand how to avoid disastrous mistakes. That's darn good value at 29th overall. — McKenna\n\nIt feels like Brown is flying under the radar in 2025 because his numbers didn't jump off the screen in Philly's run-heavy offense last year. To be clear: that's a mistake. Heading into his seventh NFL season, Brown still looks like one of the most dominant, aggressive receivers in the game and can win in the red zone, in contested catch situations and with his run-after-catch ability. There's no question he's still worth this type of pick, even at the age of 28. — Helman\n\nIf you've heard the expression lighting doesn't strike the same place twice, then you've probably heard a nerd explain that, yes, it does. Lightning is statistically more likely to strike the same place more than once. So … might it strike twice in Kansas City? Andy Reid will get the chance to develop Ward, a quarterback prospect whose traits compare most closely to Mahomes. And I'm betting that we'll see lightning strike twice in the same place. I'm betting we'll see Ward develop into an elite quarterback. — McKenna\n\nIf there are no qualified quarterbacks on the board, leave it to Howie Roseman to address the trenches. Bosa's an All-Pro and a Defensive Player of the Year at the age of 27, and he'd be a wonderful way to build the Eagles' new-look pass rush. — Helman\n\nSame philosophy as the Eagles' first pick, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. You've got to build the lines, and Jordan Mailata is one of the very best left tackles in football. Philly found him all the way back in the seventh round in 2018, but this time they make him the 33rd overall pick in the entire league and keep him home. — Helman\n\nDo I need to do the whole lightning-strikes-twice bit again? We've all heard of Travis Kelce. Well, Bowers is about to be the next Kelce. So, let's pair him with Reid in Kansas City. The Chiefs now have a new Mahomes and a new Kelce. It's a dynasty in the making. You're welcome, KC. — McKenna\n\nI already have regrets about letting Hutchinson fall this far. He's only 24, and he'd likely have been the league's DPOY in 2024 had he stayed healthy, but that's the problem. I'm not totally scared off by the injury, but just enough to let him drop to the second round. I know the Bills need a quarterback, but having these two foundational pieces feels like as good of a start as you could ask for without one. — Helman\n\nIf Nix (the new QB in Washington) is going to manage games, I'd like to have a superstar on the other side of the ball who will be my centerpiece in slowing down opposing offenses. So, let's go with the player that most people would've said was CB1 after his rookie season. Gardner is one of the NFL's best defenders. Now I have an offensive centerpiece and a defensive centerpiece and my organization can build around each of them. — McKenna\n\nI'm not sure if this is the most efficient way to build a roster, but I love the idea of the Lions gunning for the league's most terrifying pass rush. Anderson pairing with Crosby would give Detroit a dynamite duo of pass-rushers who are also strong against the run. They'll have their work cut out for them on the offensive side of the ball, but an elite defense can help a lot with that. — Helman\n\nI like Purdy. But even if you don't — even if you think he's supported by his playmakers — then you have to like where I started with Purdy and St. Brown. Purdy isn't an elite quarterback. He's a system quarterback who has no health concerns and enough upside as a passer and athlete to crack the top 10 at his position, when given the right playmakers. I don't see a problem with that. The Bengals just paid what feels like a billion dollars to retain Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Nobody is holding that against Burrow. So, I'll buy low (ish) on Purdy and build my franchise around a 25-year-old QB with Super Bowl experience. — McKenna\n\nI'm buying low and hoping to sell high on this pick. The Texans just tried the same strategy by paying Stingley immediately after his third season, which saw him nab five interceptions and finish as a first-team All-Pro. The hope is that the guy is just scratching the surface as a 24-year-old, fourth-year pro, and I'm comfortable making the bet. Even if he's only a top five or six corner in the league, he'd be worth this pick. If he continues to develop, he'll be a steal. — Helman\n\nHe hasn't thrown a pass in the NFL, but neither has Cam Ward. McCarthy probably had a comparable draft grade to Ward for most teams. And McCarthy has the added benefit of spending a year studying under O'Connell. This is a shot in the dark, given the meniscus tear. I get it. But it's a risk worth taking, given the quarterbacks that'll be available when Houston picks in the next round. Houston will regret not snagging a QB in this spot. McCarthy is a worthy prospect. — McKenna\n\nThis is incredible value for a guy who isn't even among the 10 highest-paid quarterbacks in the league, and who also doesn't turn 28 until the start of the 2025 season. Murray's size is something his coaching staff will have to take into account when they design an offense for him, but who could possibly be better suited to do that than Kevin O'Connell? — Helman\n\nThis is the first team that I've left without a quarterback after two selections. It's just a tricky spot in the draft order where the non-QBs provide too much upside and the QBs are mired in too much uncertainty. But by combining Darrisaw with Nabers, I have one of the best young cores in the NFL — and a tandem of offensive stars who are likely to elevate their quarterback (whoever it is) substantially. — McKenna\n\nPuka gets to stay in L.A., he just has to change practice facilities. Again, I'm sure Jim Harbaugh would rather draft for the line of scrimmage in a perfect world, but the value on Nacua is too good to ignore. You could easily make the case that he's a top-10 receiver in the NFL right now, he's only 23, and he has two years remaining on his rookie deal. Getting this good of a player at a premium position, this deep into the draft, is a steal. — Helman\n\nPittsburgh went defense in the first round with Surtain Jr. Now, the Steelers take the plunge on a young, unproven quarterback. Sanders is a future first-rounder with traits that coach Mike Tomlin is likely to appreciate. And Sanders' propensity for hero-ball is the type of weakness that Tomlin knows how to coach around. So, it's a really nice match. The only concern now is that Sanders will need a strong supporting cast on offense. That's where the Steelers will have to look in the rounds to come. — McKenna\n\nI'd have made Lawrence a first-round pick if not for the dislocated elbow that derailed his spectacular 2024 season. The guy was making a case to win Defensive Player of the Year from the nose tackle position, which is quite simply unheard of in modern football. Not only does he generate sacks and pressures at a high level, but he improves any team's run defense and makes life easier on the guys around him. Outstanding starting point for Denver to build its defense around.— Helman\n\nThis guy doesn't get enough love as one of the NFL's elite young receivers. But that's exactly what he is. He's had to deal with organizational instability and crappy quarterback play. Wilson has seen too many offensive coordinators. And he's seen too many WRs falsely placed above him on the depth chart (see: Allen Lazard, Davante Adams). Despite it all, he's put up three 1,000-yard seasons in as many tries. And he was ascending in 2024, with 101 catches, 1,104 yards and seven touchdowns. Let's pair Wilson, who's yet to play with an elite QB, with Maye, who's yet to play with an elite WR. Seems like something special could happen. — McKenna\n\nEven as he suits up for a division rival, it's easy to see Verse as a Seahawk. The attitude and physicality he plays with would've fit right in on the legendary Seattle defenses from a decade ago. That's exactly why Mike MacDonald would love to have him anchor his new-look pass rush. One season isn't a huge sample size, but Verse looks like he's on track to become one of the best young pass-rushers in the league. — Helman\n\nOne of the best quarterbacks in football was just … sitting there. I couldn't resist. Stafford is year-to-year when it comes to retirement. But he also can make you a Super Bowl contender every year. So, I'll bet that I can build a team, which already includes Chase, that will convince Stafford to stick around for a few years to win a title for Cincy. — McKenna\n\nIt's such a shame the hamstring injury dropped Nico off everyone's radar last fall. The guy was building a first-team All-Pro type of season before he was sidelined for five weeks. And although he still produced on the other side of the injury, it wasn't quite the same. No matter. Collins just turned 26 in March, and the Texans locked him into a team-friendly extension last year. This is great value for a guy who is already on his second NFL contract. — Helman\n\nI told myself that I'd get a QB for every team by the end of round two. But here's the second team where I've elected against that strategy. The reasoning is obvious: What QB do you want at this point? There isn't one worth taking. Plus, almost everyone in the coming order has a quarterback. So I can bank on all the quarterbacks being there when I pick next. Raimann is one of the most underrated tackles in the NFL. The Falcons now have Raimann and Justin Jefferson to support their QB. — McKenna\n\nAnother guy I'm surprised to see slipping this far. It's not just that BTJ produced at an elite level as a rookie; he also did it with uninspiring quarterback play. Thomas caught 52 passes for 687 yards and five touchdowns, just in games started by Mac Jones. One year isn't a huge sample size, but the guy has the makings of a superstar. And, of course, he's on a cheap contract for at least three more years. It's easy to imagine Dak Prescott finding him deep down the seam, week after week. — Helman\n\nI'm now the only GM who has secured a starter at three positions with only two selections. I'd like a parade — or at least a cookie. Hunter can learn from Myles Garrett about professionalism and leadership. And Hunter can serve as the team's playmaker at both cornerback and receiver. The prospect wants to play full time on both sides of the ball, and I'm happy to give that a go. Let's see how the depth chart fills out before deciding which position to make his primary focus for Week 1. (But I'm leaning WR.) And then if that goes well, let's see whether he can handle a full starter's share of snaps going both ways. — McKenna\n\nI bet Watt would be furious to fall this far in a re-draft, but the blunt truth is that he's turning 31 this fall and he's seeking a new contract that could place him among the two or three highest-paid defenders in the NFL. That's a tough combo. At the end of the day, though, he's still likely got several years of high-level play left in the tank. If he were to fall to this spot, I just love the poetic justice of the Cowboys rectifying the wrongs of 2017 by drafting him this time around. — Helman\n\nMayfield gets a blindside protector. I think Cross offers more upside and stability to the team, and while I like Mayfield, I also respect that he's had the joy of working with Wirfs, the first tackle off the board in this exercise. I don't have to perfectly recreate Mayfield's situation in Tampa to help the QB succeed, but I recognize the importance of a good tackle to keep the oven broiling at The Bake Off. — McKenna\n\nHines-Allen tends to get forgotten among the ranks of the league's best pass-rushers — probably because he plays in Jacksonville. That won't be the case with his new team, as I've got the Bears drafting him to be the centerpiece of their defense. Hines-Allen has finished 10th, fifth and 12th in total pressures the past three seasons, and he put together a 17-sack season in 2024. The Bears would be happy to find a guy capable of anchoring their pass rush, just 10 picks away from the end of the second round. — Helman\n\nI talked about how Jared Goff could age like fine wine. Well, by picking Thomas, I'm ensuring we don't shatter the bottle. Because we all know that a pocket passer is only as good as his pocket. Goff had Sewell in Detroit. Let's get him Thomas in New Orleans. — McKenna\n\nIt's a Buckeye party in Charlotte. McLaurin didn't overlap with C.J. Stroud at Ohio State, but they'd have to be thrilled to link up in the NFL. McLaurin is a deep-ball and contested catch specialist, which would pair perfectly with Stroud's arm strength. McLaurin is a bit on the older side for a wideout, but at this stage of our exercise, it's still solid value to find an All-Pro-caliber receiver available. — Helman\n\nMcConkey isn't the same player as A.J. Brown, but there are more similarities than you'd think. And it doesn't matter all that much, with Hurts showing a strong ability to work with every body type and style of pass-catcher in the Philly offense. McConkey also showed he's comfortable working as the WR1 in a run-first offense (in L.A.), which is likely what the Jets are going to run with Hurts. It's a really nice match for a WR who seems to have all the upside in the world. — McKenna\n\nThe options at receiver feel like they're starting to dwindle, but that's no problem for the Raiders. McBride has caught 192 passes over the past two seasons, emerging as one of the best tight ends in the new generation at the position. He can play in-line, and he can also break out into the slot. Justin Herbert will still need a field-stretching option at receiver, but McBride would be a high-end safety blanket for that offense. — Helman\n\nIt feels like he's been in the NFL forever, but he's only 24 and has the versatility and talent to be one of the best corners in the NFL on the perimeter and in the slot. Jacksonville now has an elite playmaker and leaders on both sides of the ball, with McDuffie and Jayden Daniels. The Jags would pick again shortly, and I'd probably stock up on offensive players in the picks to come to help prevent a sophomore slump from Daniels. — McKenna\n\nJones suffered from the same problem as T.J. Watt in this exercise. He's undoubtedly one of the game's best, but he is also neither cheap nor young. Way back at the end of the second round, though, the Patriots should be willing to gamble that they can get at least a few more years of quality play from the 31-year-old. Jones' presence would give their defense a high floor for at least two or three years while they wait for their younger talent to grow into their roles. — Helman\n\nWhen you have a one-man offense in Lamar, you don't necessarily have to rush to add playmakers on that side of the ball. Highsmith is one of the most underappreciated playmakers, but his contract (at four years and $68 million) should give out a sense of his value. The 27-year-old edge has done everything in his career, from run-defending to efficient pass-rushing. He's going to be a cornerstone piece on the front seven. He'll make everything work in the defense's favor. — McKenna\n\nIt feels unfair to land a prospect this good with the second-to-last pick of the exercise. The Browns took Josh Allen way back at No. 2, and now with pick No. 63, they can protect him with a rising star at tackle. Alt had some growing pains after the Chargers swapped him to the right side, but he had an incredibly promising rookie season and figures to grow into a Pro Bowl-caliber player. It makes all the sense in the world to pick him to help Josh Allen. The Browns' only real question is whether they want to play him on the right or the left. — Helman\n\nTexans edge Will Anderson said that Tom is the best offensive lineman he's faced in the NFL. It was one of the first comments that put Tom on the map after he entered the NFL as a compelling, versatile offensive lineman as a fourth-rounder in 2022. Would he play guard? Would he play right tackle? Turns out, he's a left tackle — and a dang good one. He's 26 and not going to be the reason Mahomes loses in the Super Bowl. So, I'm happy. — McKenna\n\nTitans: QB Mahomes, OT TomBrowns: QB Allen, OT AltGiants: QB Jackson, OLB HighsmithPatriots: QB Burrow, DT JonesJaguars: QB Daniels, CB McDuffieRaiders: QB Herbert, TE McBrideJets: QB Hurts, WR McConkeyPanthers: QB Stroud, WR McLaurinSaints: QB Goff, OT ThomasBears: QB Love, DE Hines-Allen49ers: QB Mayfield, OT CrossCowboys: QB Williams, OLB WattDolphins: DE Garrett, WR/CB HunterColts: QB Prescott, WR ThomasFalcons: WR Jefferson, OT RaimannCardinals: OLB Parsons, WR CollinsBengals: WR Chase, QB StaffordSeahawks: OT Wirfs, OLB VerseBuccaneers: QB Maye, WR WilsonBroncos: WR Lamb, DT LawrenceSteelers: CB Surtain, QB SandersChargers: OT Sewell, WR NacuaPackers: WR Nabers, OT DarrisawVikings: DT Carter, QB MurrayTexans: OT Slater, QB McCarthyRams: QB Lawrence, CB StingleyRavens: WR St. Brown, QB PurdyLions: DE Crosby, OLB AndersonCommanders: QB Nix, CB GardnerBills: WR Brown, DE HutchisonChiefs: QB Ward, TE BowersEagles: DE Bosa, OT Mailata\n\nQuarterbacks: 22Wide receivers: 13 (including Travis Hunter)Edge defenders: 10Offensive tackles: 10Cornerbacks: 5 (including Travis Hunter)Defensive tackles: 3Tight ends: 2\n\nPrior to joining FOX Sports as an NFL reporter and columnist, Henry McKenna spent seven years covering the Patriots for USA TODAY Sports Media Group and Boston Globe Media.

    "body": "Chiney Ogwumike is excited to see what Anthony Edwards does in the Lakers-Wolves playoff matchup. (0:52)\n\nTuesday afternoon, I opened my official NBA awards ballot and voted for my selections for all of the league's top individual honors: the seven major end-of-season awards (Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Improved Player and Clutch Player of the Year), plus the All-NBA, All-Defense and All-Rookie teams.\n\nHere's what that ballot looked like and how each pick was made (with a shoutout to the great Matt \"Stats\" Williams for all of the information we could want for our ballots).\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander tallies 42 points with six assists in the Thunder's 136-120 win vs. the Lakers.\n\nJust about every season, there are several deserving MVP candidates. And this year's race truly went down to the final day between Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic, the league's two best players, both of whom have put together unbelievable seasons.\n\nThe Thunder, behind Gilgeous-Alexander's league-leading 32.7 points per game while shooting 51.9% from the field, became the seventh team in NBA history to win at least 68 games. Jokic, of course, had a historic statistical season, finishing in the top three in points (29.6), rebounds (12.7) and assists (10.2) while shooting 57.6% overall and 41.7% from 3-point range. Truly video game stuff.\n\nIronically, while going back-and-forth between Gilgeous-Alexander and Jokic over the past several weeks, this quote from since-fired Nuggets coach Michael Malone has been weighing on my mind. \"If you didn't know Nikola had won three MVPs, and I put Player A and Player B on paper ... he wins 10 times out of 10,\" Malone said last month.\n\n\"And if you don't think so, you guys are full of s---.\"\n\nMalone's position was totally defensible. But to win a fourth MVP award in five years -- something only LeBron James and Bill Russell have done -- Jokic was going to have to do something extraordinary. And he has.\n\nBut if the race is a toss-up, like virtually every person I've talked to in the media and among players, coaches and executives believes it is, the edge should go to the leader of arguably the most dominant regular-season team in NBA history.\n\nThe Thunder set the record for point differential, outscoring opponents by over 1,000 points, and by 12.7 points per 100 possessions. They stacked 68 wins in a season in which Chet Holmgren missed 50 games and summer acquisitions Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso both missed significant chunks.\n\nThe Nuggets were nearly 20 points better with Jokic on the court. But while Oklahoma City obviously has more talent than Denver does around Jokic, the Thunder were still 11.5 points per 100 possessions worse when Gilgeous-Alexander sat. And without its engine, the NBA's No. 1 offense turns into one that would rank 22nd leaguewide.\n\nAs for the rest of the ballot, Antetokounmpo was an easy pick in the third spot, and this will be a seventh straight season he has been inside the top four. There was a time when you could argue Tatum should be third, but Antetokounmpo's closing kick over the past couple months -- particularly after Milwaukee lost Damian Lillard to a blood clot issue in his calf -- pushed him ahead of Tatum.\n\nThere was a massive gap between Tatum and a host of players who merited consideration for the fifth spot, with the choice ultimately coming down to Brunson and Donovan Mitchell. In the end, Brunson gets the fifth spot for his clutch-time heroics, which may lead to some other hardware for the Knicks captain.\n\nThrough the All-Star break, the only debate about DPOY was who would finish second to Victor Wembanyama. But once the San Antonio Spurs phenom was lost for the season because of his deep vein thrombosis diagnosis, it broke open the race, with several players -- the three listed, plus Rudy Gobert, Draymond Green, Dyson Daniels, Amen Thompson and Luguentz Dort -- all likely to get votes and perhaps all of them getting at least one first-place selection.\n\nIt ended up being a discussion between Zubac and Mobley. The Clippers have been one of the best defensive teams in the league, ranking third in defensive rating. Zubac has been in the middle of all of it, allowing the lowest shot quality as the contesting defender among players contesting at least 700 shots this season, per GenuisIQ tracking data. Mobley, on the other hand, might be the league's most versatile defender. He's the only player to defend guards, forwards and centers for at least 900 half-court matchups this season, providing the kind of Swiss Army knife teams covet in today's pace-and-space dominated game.\n\nUltimately, the edge went to Zubac. He played nine more games and an extra 500 minutes than Mobley. And his massive presence in the paint powered the Clippers to that top-five defensive rating, which was just enough to surpass the Cavs' All-Star big man.\n\nLike Mobley, Jackson's versatility is his biggest calling card, with Memphis' defense being more than four points per 100 worse with him on the bench. Jackson is the only player besides Mobley to defend guards, forwards and centers each for at least 800 possessions this season while being the only player to have at least 75 steals and 100 blocks.\n\nThe top two names have been in place for weeks, but I flip-flopped on them repeatedly since mid-March. The Pistons more than tripling their win total since last season is a remarkable accomplishment, and Bickerstaff has done a fantastic job getting defensive buy-in from his young roster.\n\nWednesday, April 16: Play-in\nNo. 10 Heat at No. 9  Bulls, 7:30 p.m.\nNo. 10 Mavericks at No. 9 Kings, 10 p.m.\n\nFriday, April 18: Play-in\nTBD vs. No. 8 Grizzlies, 9:30 p.m\n\nSaturday, April 19: Playoffs (Game 1s)\nNo. 6 Pistons vs. No. 3 Knicks, 3 p.m\nNo. 6 Timberwolves vs. No. 3 Lakers, 3 p.m (ABC)\n\nBut the hardest jump to make in the NBA -- for both player and team -- is not going from awful to good; it's going from good to great. The Cavaliers went from a team that was expected to be in the mix for home-court advantage in the first round to having home court throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs, winning 64 games and seeing massive improvement from players across the roster.\n\nThe other two coaches who merit first-place votes are Udoka -- he guided a team I thought would be fighting for a play-in spot to the second seed in the Western Conference -- and LA Clippers coach Tyronn Lue. The Clippers have flown under the radar all season, but Lue has done a remarkable job with this group while once again dealing with uncertainty surrounding Kawhi Leonard's availability. Lue should get votes for this award, and it was painful leaving him off the ballot.\n\nZaccharie Risacher scorches the Brooklyn Nets for a career-high 38 points.\n\nLet's just say this year's race isn't like last year's, when Wembanyama and Holmgren were both hugely impactful as rookies and would have both been runaway winners for the award in just about any season over the past 20 years.\n\nThis season's choice boiled down to Castle, who has taken on a bigger individual role in San Antonio, or Risacher, who has carved an effective role on a team competing for a playoff spot. I went with the latter, as Risacher -- the top pick in last year's draft -- has averaged 14 points and shot 50% from the field and 40% from 3-point range since Jan. 1.\n\nWells, a second-round pick who became a starter for another playoff hopeful in the Memphis Grizzlies, checked in third. (Speaking of Wells, it was good to see he was OK after an incredibly scary fall that saw him suffer a season-ending broken wrist last week against the Charlotte Hornets.)\n\nFrankly, I wish this award didn't exist. Back in 1986, when the NBA retired the Comeback Player of the Year award, then-deputy commissioner Russ Granik said, \"We phased it out because it became very difficult to determine with any kind of clarity exactly what the requirements were.\"\n\nI would argue the same applies to this award. What constitutes the most improvement? What matters the most? It's always an award that a dozen players can make a case for, and it has tended to default, as Lakers coach JJ Redick said recently, to young, highly drafted players who make a leap.\n\nFrom the play-in tournament to the NBA Finals, ESPN has you covered throughout the playoffs.\n\n• Postseason preview: Big questions for all 20 teams\n• Pelton: 25 names to watch, including top stars\n• Kram: 13 non-stars who could swing the 1st round\n• Offseason guide: What's next for eliminated teams\n• What to know: News, schedule, scores, highlights\n\nThat is how the top of my ballot has played out this season, with Mobley getting the top spot. Going from little to no All-Star buzz last year to an All-NBA pick this season makes him worthy of the honor.\n\nZubac has had a remarkable season at both ends for the Clippers, seeing massive jumps in virtually every category -- including, most importantly, minutes per game, as he's been asked to take on a significantly bigger load and has done so with aplomb. Reaves, meanwhile, has not only shined after Luka Doncic arrived with the Lakers, but he has been a massive reason for the Lakers' second-half surge to the West's third seed.\n\nThis was one of the easiest decisions on the ballot. Pritchard has been, at worst, the third-most consistent player on the Celtics  (behind Tatum and Derrick White), giving this team terrific energy and production off the bench. As a 40% 3-point shooter on nearly eight attempts per game, he has repeatedly sparked Boston wins throughout the year and has been my clear Sixth Man leader for months.\n\nThe last two spots could go in a few directions, with Alexander-Walker, Beasley and two Cavaliers -- De'Andre Hunter and Ty Jerome -- being the final contenders. Hunter has arguably had his best season, first with the Atlanta Hawks and now the Cavaliers after a midseason trade. Hunter has cleaned up his shot profile and scored a career-high 17 points per game.\n\nJerome, on the other hand, is one of the best stories across the entire league, going from missing virtually all of last season because of injuries to averaging 12.5 points on 51.6% shooting overall and 43.6% from 3.\n\nBut my votes for second and third went elsewhere. Alexander-Walker has been an unsung hero for Minnesota as a two-way weapon able to operate on and off the ball as the Timberwolves dealt with injuries to Donte DiVincenzo and Mike Conley during the year. Alexander-Walker shot 38.1% from deep and has been a good defender who can close games.\n\nMy third spot went to Beasley, who is seventh in the league with more than nine attempts per game, and at 41.6% he's the only player inside the top 20 in attempts to also shoot 40% for the season. Beasley's career year has played a major role in Detroit's surge.\n\nWhile I considered putting LeBron James on here, these three guys were the pretty clear choices for me, and in this order. Brunson's 5.6 points per game in the clutch this season are the third most in a season in the past 25 years for players who played in at least 20 clutch games, and he consistently was pulling out close games for New York while sporting the league's highest usage rate in the clutch.\n\nJokic, like in just about any other situation, excelled here, ranking inside the top five in clutch points and assists, while Young led in total points and assists in the fourth quarter and was the first player in almost 30 years (since John Stockton in 1997) to have at least 200 fourth-quarter assists in a season.\n\nJokic makes history as the first player to post a 30-point, 20-rebound, 20-assist triple-double.\n\nI gave my reasoning behind my first-team All-NBA ballot at the top of this piece when I filled out my MVP ballot, so we'll move on to the rest of the ballot here.\n\nWe've spent enough time talking about Mobley, too, whose terrific season made him an easy choice alongside Mitchell. The fact we are talking about LeBron, as the league's oldest player, and Stephen Curry, as one of 13 players in the league over 37, as top-10 players in the league at this stage of their careers is remarkable.\n\nThe final second-team spot, after some deliberation, went to Edwards, a two-way force whose remarkable improvement as a 3-point shooter -- he made a league-high 320 triples on more than 39% shooting -- could be a game-breaking development as his young career progresses.\n\nIf there was any doubt about whether Harden deserves to be an All-NBA selection this season, his performance Sunday -- 39 points and 10 assists on 13-for-23 shooting, including scoring 12 of LA's 13 overtime points in the playoff-clinching win over Golden State -- showed how essential he's been to the Clippers. Cunningham's breakthrough season in Detroit made him an easy pick for a spot here, with the same being said for Towns in his first season as a Knick and Williams for the league-leading Thunder.\n\nThat left one final spot, for which I debated four players: Haliburton, Jackson, Zubac and Darius Garland. The latter two both had great seasons, but the choice came down to a Haliburton and Jackson. The Pacers had a slow start with a second-half surge; Memphis was the opposite. In the end, Jackson's two-way play -- and being more consistent during the season -- made him the choice over Haliburton.\n\nDyson Daniels jumps the passing lane and takes it coast-to-coast for an easy Hawks bucket.\n\nThree of these names here were on my DPOY ballot. As for the other two spots, I included two backcourt-type players and three frontcourt-type players, as was the format before the league made All-Defensive selections positionless in 2023-24.\n\nDaniels had the most steals in a season in a generation, while Thompson, an incredible defensive weapon who can guard just about any position, showed his on-ball prowess by helping Houston hold Stephen Curry to just three points in a matchup last week.\n\nGobert and Green were easy choices, as they both remain excellent defenders into their mid-30s. Dort, meanwhile, consistently takes the top assignments for Oklahoma City and should earn his first All-Defense selection.\n\nThat left three players for two spots: White, Williams and Portland Trail Blazers wing Toumani Camara, who has become an elite stopper in his second NBA season. I opted to reward Williams and White, two versatile two-way players for teams with the best chances to reach the Finals.\n\nAfter my Rookie of the Year top three, Ware and Edey round out my top five.\n\nWare nearly averaged a double-double on almost 55% shooting over the final 2½ months, while Edey provided a solid presence in the paint for Memphis all season long, despite playing just 21.5 minutes per game.\n\nMissi has been one of the more consistent players on the Pelicans all season, while Clingan was an impactful rookie center for Portland and averaged 10 rebounds and more than two blocks per game as a starter. Sarr still has a long way to go as a shooter but improved as the season went along and showed flashes of the player the Wizards hope he can be.\n\nDunn was a solid wing defender for the Suns whose long-term ceiling will be determined by his 3-point shot, which started off hot and waned considerably as the year progressed. With the final spot, I went with Buzelis, who is starting for Chicago and has shown flashes of elite two-way play during the Bulls' 10-3 close to the season.",

DUF1874-family members are also found fused to CRISPR effectors such as Csx14, or as stand-alone genes at CRISPR loci, where they have been named Crn2 proteins1. In both cases, their role seems to be degradation of cA4 (ring-nuclease activity) to switch off CRISPR defence. AcrIII-1 and Crn2 are cA4-specific ring nucleases in vitro, and the acrIII-1 gene from the archaeal rudivirus SIRV1 was shown to overcome type III CRISPR immunity in S. islandicus M.16.4 when expressed from a plasmid, allowing infection with the virus SSeV1.

    "body": "Japanese-led team grow 11g chunk of chicken – and say product could be on market in five- to 10 years\n\nResearchers are claiming a breakthrough in lab-grown meat after producing nugget-sized chunks of chicken in a device that mimics the blood vessels that make up the circulatory system.\n\nThe approach uses fine hollow fibres to deliver oxygen and nutrients to chicken muscle cells suspended in a gel, an advance that allowed scientists to grow lumps of meat up to 2cm long and 1cm thick.\n\nThe hollow fibre bioreactor paves the way for whole cuts of chicken, beef, pork and fish to be grown in the lab, researchers believe. The same technology has the potential to produce functional organs, too.\n\n“This looks like a transformative step, it’s a really elegant solution,” said Prof Derek Stewart at the James Hutton Institute in Dundee. “They’ve created something of a size and scale that people are hardwired to eat: it’s the chicken nugget model.”\n\nA major hurdle to growing meat in the lab is the difficulty in getting enough nutrients and oxygen to muscle cells in thick sections of tissue. Without them, the cells die off. As such, many projects focus on growing tiny pieces of meat akin to mince.\n\nTo solve the size problem, Prof Shoji Takeuchi, at the University of Tokyo, built a bioreactor that holds living cells in a gel and feeds them with oxygen and nutrients through fine, semi-permeable fibres that pass through the material.\n\n“One of the key challenges in growing thick tissue is that cells in the centre can struggle to receive enough oxygen and nutrients, which may lead to cell death,” Takeuchi said. “Our system helped address this by providing internal perfusion, allowing us to support the growth of thicker, more consistent tissue.”\n\nWriting in Trends in Biotechnology, Takeuchi and his team describe how they grew an 11g chunk of chicken from a gel that had more than 1,000 hollow fibres running through it. A culture medium rich in nutrients and oxygen was pumped down the fibres to nourish the cells.\n\nGrowing meat in larger, more structured pieces could help researchers replicate the texture and appearance of meat such as chicken breast or thigh, Takeuchi said. “While small-scale or minced cultured meat is easier to produce, it may not fully capture the fibrous structure and mouth-feel that consumers associate with conventional cuts,” he added.\n\nFor now, the hollow fibres of the artificial circulatory system must be removed by hand once the meat has grown. But the scientists are aiming to replace them with edible cellulose fibres that can be left in and used to vary the texture of the meat.\n\nEdible fibres may open up other possibilities, too, Stewart said. Meats could be fortified by adding zinc and selenium to the culture medium, helping to boost the immune systems of older people, he suggested. He also wondered if masala sauce could be passed down the tubes to create a nugget version of chicken tikka masala. “I’d give it a go,” he said.\n\nTakeuchi said future versions of the bioreactor may need artificial blood that carries more oxygen to the cells, to allow the growth of larger lumps of meat. With sufficient funding, he believes products based on the approach could be available in five- to 10 years.\n\n“At first, it will likely be more expensive than conventional chicken, mainly due to material and production costs,” he said. “However, we are actively developing food-grade, scalable systems, and if successful, we expect the cost to decrease substantially over time.”",

    "body": "The James Webb Space Telescope has discovered Zhúlóng, a candidate for the most distant spiral galaxy in the universe. The perplexing Milky Way 'twin' dates to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, and appears too big to explain.\n\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.\n\n\nWhen astronomers used the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to peer deep into the early universe, they made a serendipitous discovery: a galaxy that appears to be the Milky Way's ancient twin sibling waving its spiral arms back at us.\n\nIn new images that capture light emitted just 1 billion years after the Big Bang, when the universe was roughly one-fourteenth its current age, the newly discovered galaxy appears fully formed, with a central bulge of old stars, a vibrant disk of stellar newborns, and two distinct spiral arms. Given its recognizable features and impressive size, the researchers have dubbed this galaxy the most distant Milky Way \"twin\" ever observed.\n\nThe detection of such a fully formed spiral galaxy so early in cosmic time adds to many recent JWST discoveries that challenge our best theories of cosmology, which predict that large galaxies like this should take several billion years to form through an arduous series of smaller galaxy mergers.\n\nA full description of the galaxy — nicknamed Zhúlóng, after a mythical Chinese sun dragon whose eyes controlled the day and night cycle — was published April 16 in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n\n\"What makes Zhúlóng stand out is just how much it resembles the Milky Way — both in shape, size, and stellar mass,\" first study author Mengyuan Xiao, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Geneva, said in a statement.\n\nWhile Zhúlóng is unquestionably older than the Milky Way, it could be mistaken for our galaxy's \"little\" sibling. The new research estimates that Zhúlóng's star-forming disk measures about 60,000 light-years across, compared with our galaxy's 100,000 light-year breadth, and it contains about 100 billion solar masses, compared with the Milky Way's 1.5 trillion.\n\nStill, Zhúlóng is by far the largest Milky Way look-alike spotted at such an early time in the universe's history. It formed more than a billion years earlier than the similarly shaped spiral galaxy Ceers-2112, which JWST discovered in 2023 at about 11.7 billion light-years from Earth.\n\nGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nRelated: 42 jaw-dropping James Webb Space Telescope images\n\nNo genealogical tests were needed to find this long-lost sibling; the researchers discovered it by accident in PANORAMIC, a wide-field survey of billions of distant objects. The survey was taken in JWST's unique \"pure parallel\" mode — essentially, a way for the telescope to use two of its infrared instruments simultaneously to observe two different regions of space at once.\n\n\"This allows JWST to map large areas of the sky, which is essential for discovering massive galaxies, as they are incredibly rare,\" study co-author Christina Williams, an assistant astronomer at the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab and principal investigator of the PANORAMIC survey, said in the statement.\n\nThe serendipitous discovery of Zhúlóng adds fuel to an ongoing cosmological fire started by JWST several years ago. The telescope's observations of the early universe consistently show that objects there, including gargantuan galaxies and supermassive black holes, seem to have grown too big, too fast for our current best theories to explain.\n\nIt's thought that the Milky Way took several billion years to form, while Zhúlóng seems to have achieved a similar shape and size in less than 1 billion years. How this is possible remains \"an open question,\" the team wrote in the study.\n\n—Rare quadruple supernova on our 'cosmic doorstep' will shine brighter than the moon when it blows up in 23 billion years\n\n—Atacama Telescope reveals earliest-ever 'baby pictures' of the universe: 'We can see right back through cosmic history'\n\n—Scientists discover smallest galaxy ever seen: 'It's like having a perfectly functional human being that's the size of a grain of rice'\n\n\"This discovery shows how JWST is fundamentally changing our view of the early universe,\" study co-author Pascal Oesch, an associate professor of astronomy at the University of Geneva and co-principal investigator of the PANORAMIC program, concluded in the statement.\n\nThe researchers are proposing follow-up observations with JWST, as well as with the ground-based Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in the Chilean desert, to get to know our galaxy's long-lost twin even better.\n\nBrandon is the space/physics editor at Live Science.

    "body": "A new study by Brown University researchers suggests that gold nanoparticles -- microscopic bits of gold thousands of times thinner than a human hair -- might one day be used to help restore vision in people with macular degeneration and other retinal disorders.\n\nIn a study published in the journal ACS Nano and supported by the National Institutes of Health, the research team showed that nanoparticles injected into the retina can successfully stimulate the visual system and restore vision in mice with retinal disorders. The findings suggest that a new type of visual prosthesis system in which nanoparticles, used in combination with a small laser device worn in a pair of glasses or goggles, might one day help people with retinal disorders to see again.\n\n\"This is a new type of retinal prosthesis that has the potential to restore vision lost to retinal degeneration without requiring any kind of complicated surgery or genetic modification,\" said Jiarui Nie, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health who led the research while completing her Ph.D. at Brown. \"We believe this technique could potentially transform treatment paradigms for retinal degenerative conditions.\"\n\nNie performed the work while working in the lab of Jonghwan Lee, an associate professor in Brown's School of Engineering and a faculty affiliate at Brown's Carney Institute for Brain Science, who oversaw the work and served as the study's senior author.\n\nRetinal disorders like macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa affect millions of people in the U.S. and around the world. These conditions damage light-sensitive cells in the retina called photoreceptors -- the \"rods\" and \"cones\" that convert light into tiny electric pulses. Those pulses stimulate other types of cells further up the visual chain called bipolar and ganglion cells, which process the photoreceptor signals and send them along to the brain.\n\nThis new approach uses nanoparticles injected directly into the retina to bypass damaged photoreceptors. When infrared light is focused on the nanoparticles, they generate a tiny amount of heat that activates bipolar and ganglion cells in much the same way that photoreceptor pulses do. Because disorders like macular degeneration affect mostly photoreceptors while leaving bipolar and ganglion cells intact, the strategy has the potential to restore lost vision.\n\nIn this new study, the research team tested the nanoparticle approach in mouse retinas and in living mice with retinal disorders. After injecting a liquid nanoparticle solution, the researchers used patterned near-infrared laser light to project shapes onto the retinas. Using a calcium signal to detect cellular activity, the team confirmed that the nanoparticles were exciting bipolar and ganglion cells in patterns matched the shapes projected by the laser.\n\nThe experiments showed that neither the nanoparticle solution nor the laser stimulation caused detectable adverse side effects, as indicated by metabolic markers for inflammation and toxicity. Using probes, the researchers confirmed that laser stimulation of the nanoparticles caused increased activity in the visual cortices of the mice -- an indication that previously absent visual signals were being transmitted and processed by the brain. That, the researchers say, is a sign that vision had been at least partially restored, a good sign for potentially translating a similar technology to humans.\n\nFor human use, the researchers envision a system that combines the nanoparticles with a laser system mounted in a pair of glasses or goggles. Cameras in the goggles would gather image data from the outside world and use it to drive the patterning of an infrared laser. The laser pulses would then stimulate the nanoparticles in people's retinas, enabling them to see.\n\nThe approach is similar to one that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use a few years ago. The older approach combined a camera system with a small electrode array that was surgically implanted in the eye. The nanoparticle approach has several key advantages, according to Nie.\n\nFor starters, it's far less invasive. As opposed to surgery, \"an intravitreal injection is one of the simplest procedures in ophthalmology,\" Nie said.\n\nThere are functional advantages as well. The resolution of the previous approach was limited by the size of the electrode array -- about 60 square pixels. Because the nanoparticle solution covers the whole retina, the new approach could potentially cover someone's full field of vision. And because the nanoparticles respond to near-infrared light as opposed to visual light, the system doesn't necessarily interfere with any residual vision a person may retain.\n\nMore work needs to be done before the approach can be tried in a clinical setting, Nie said, but this early research suggests that it's possible.\n\n\"We showed that the nanoparticles can stay in the retina for months with no major toxicity,\" Nie said of the research. \"And we showed that they can successfully stimulate the visual system. That's very encouraging for future applications.\"\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Eye Institute (R01EY030569), the China Scholarship Council scholarship, the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission scholarship, and South Korea's Alchemist Project Program (RS-2024-00422269).

    "body": "The image of Luke Skywalker gazing wistfully across the desert of Tatooine while a pair of “suns” set on the horizon is among of the most famous scenes in pop culture. When Star Wars debuted in 1977, astronomers had yet to confirm an exoplanet with the same orbital path as Skywalker’s home world. It would take another 16 years before experts located an actual circumbinary planet in 1993. Still, only 15 examples have been located to date—but researchers now have strong evidence suggesting another should be added to the list. What’s more, it’s one of the most unique binary systems ever observed. The evidence was published on April 16 in the journal Science Advances.\n\nWhen you imagine a stellar system and its orbiting planets, chances are it largely resembles our own solar system. In actuality, our cosmic neighborhood is actually a comparatively rare sight. Of the nearly 6,000 exoplanets documented so far, more than 75 percent exist in stellar orbits radically different from our own. One of the rarest variations is a binary system, in which the path of a planet revolves around two stars. However, the exoplanet 2M1510’s binary system includes a slightly different pairing: brown dwarfs.\n\nBrown dwarfs are cosmic oddballs—while too large to classify as planets, they’re also too small to truly meet the definition of a star. But at 13 to 80 times the mass of Jupiter, they exhibit more than enough gravitational pull to draw objects into orbit. 2M1510 is one such object. However,  in this case, there are two brown dwarfs involved here. The result, according to researchers, is an exoplanet that “eccentrically orbits” the pair.\n\nTo confirm the rarely detected space oddity, astronomers utilized radial velocity calculations to examine data previously collected by NASA’s Kepler space telescope, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), as well as the European Space Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope (VLT). This combination of tools and analyses allowed astronomers to bypass  a longstanding physic issue called the three-body problem. This conundrum makes it extremely difficult to assess gravitational behavior between three objects interacting in space.\n\nThe resulting evidence strongly suggests 2M1510 orbits at a 90-degree polar angle, and moves perpendicular to the dwarfs’ orbits in a never-before-seen way. Adding to its uniqueness, the brown dwarfs are eclipsing, meaning that one of them is always partially obscured when seen from Earth. This also makes it only the second eclipsing brown dwarf binary system ever documented.\n\n“A planet orbiting not just a binary, but a binary brown dwarf, as well as being on a polar orbit is rather incredible and exciting,” Amaury Triaud, a study co-author and professor at the University of Birmingham, said in a statement.\n\nAccording to an accompanying Science Advances “Focus” feature, the system also “provides strong, if indirect, evidence for the existence of one of the most exotic types of exoplanetary systems yet found.”\n\nBut as rare a find as it is, it’s possible that 2M1510 once had an even more surreal skyscape. That’s because they aren’t only two brown dwarfs in the cosmic neighborhood. A third, more distant brown dwarf is located at the system’s periphery. According to the study’s authors, this hints at a time when a trio of brown dwarfs occupied the system’s center before the gravitational forces pushed it out of the unit. At this point, however, only time will tell if a three-star planet makes it into a Star Wars film.\n\nAndrew Paul is Popular Science’s staff writer covering tech news.\n\nBreakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nArticles may contain affiliate links which enable us to share in the revenue of any purchases made.\n\nRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our Terms of Service.\n\n© 2025 Recurrent.

    "body": "The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a ten-year high, according to data obtained by campaigners.\n\nSurfers Against Sewage said the Environment Agency data showed the number of incidents was more than double its target.\n\nSuch spills have the potential to cause damage to wildlife and illness for people making use of the country's rivers and seas.\n\nWater UK, the industry body representing UK water and sewage companies, said companies plan to invest £12bn to reduce spills by the end of the decade.\n\nAs well as reporting the total number of sewage spills annually, environmental regulator the Environment Agency also records the number of pollution incidents, which are likely to cause serious harm to wildlife and people. \n\nEight years ago, the EA remarked that the water sector was not doing enough to reduce these incidents. It said this was causing \"distress to local communities and blighting rivers and beaches.\"\n\nThe industry was set a target to reduce these incidents by 40% by 2025 against 2016 levels. \n\nThe latest publicly availably data is to the end of 2023. But following a Freedom of Information request, Surfers Against Sewage obtained the data up to the start of 2025.\n\nThis showed that 2,487 pollution incidents were recorded last year - a 31% increase on the 2016 levels, and almost double the original EA target. \n\n\"The water industry fails, fails and fails again,\" said Giles Bristow, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage. \n\nHe called for a reform of the system so that it \"prioritises public health and value for customer money and delivers healthy coastlines, rivers and lakes.\"\n\nWater UK responded to the findings on behalf of the nine companies responsible for handling sewage in England. \n\n\"We have been clear that the water system is not working and support the Independent Water Commission looking at every aspect of how the industry is regulated.\n\n\"However, no sewage spill is ever acceptable and water companies are investing £12 billion to almost halve spills from storm overflows by 2030,\" Water UK said.\n\nMost of the money for that investment is expected to come from increases to water bills, which started to take effect this month. \n\nThe industry regulator Ofwat is allowing water companies to raise bills by an average of £31 each year over the next five years - but those rises don't include inflation, which means actual bills are likely to be higher.\n\nThe Water Commission is an independent review, set up by the government, to look at different ways of regulating the industry following increased public anger over water company performance.\n\nChairman Sir Jon Cunliffe, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, is inviting submissions from the public until next week.\n\nA consultation, which ends on Wednesday, focuses on five Belfast parks - Ormeau, Woodvale, Falls, Belmont and Botanic Gardens.\n\nA wildlife expert says it is \"absolutely fantastic\" to see an otter in such a \"highly urbanised\" area.\n\nBlue-green algae has been detected in Lough Neagh at both Traad Point and Kinturk (Curran's Quay). \n\nProposed plant will prepare emissions taken from an incinerator on site for transport and storage. \n\nThe theme is Around the World and the children choose Worcester because it is their favourite place.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

    "body": "An expedition spotted a baby of the species in the South Sandwich Islands. This cephalopod can grow to more than 20 feet and has proved elusive in its deep-sea environs.\n\nIn March, Kat Bolstad returned from an Antarctic expedition where she had used a new camera system specially built to search for the elusive colossal squid.\n\nNo one had captured footage of one of these animals swimming in the deep sea. She didn’t spot one on this voyage either.\n\nOn the day she left the ship, though, Dr. Bolstad, a deep sea cephalopod biologist, learned about a recent video taken on March 9 from the South Sandwich Islands. A team searching for new marine life and remotely using a Schmidt Ocean Institute submersible, had happened upon a young cephalopod, and people wanted Dr. Bolstad’s help identifying it.\n\nThe juvenile was about 30 centimeters long (a little less than a foot), with a transparent body, delicate arms and brown spots. It was a colossal squid.\n\n“Pretty much as soon as I saw the footage, I knew there was a good chance,” Dr. Bolstad, a cephalopod biologist at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, said. She consults remotely for Schmidt’s Antarctic work.\n\nIt’s been 100 years since the colossal squid was formally described in a scientific paper. In its adult form, the animal is larger than the giant squid, or any other invertebrate on Earth, and can grow to 6 or 7 meters long, or up to 23 feet.\n\nScientists’ first good look at the species in 1925 was incomplete — just arm fragments from two squid in the belly of a sperm whale. Adults are thought to spend most of their time in the deep ocean.\n\nA full-grown colossal squid occasionally appears at the ocean’s surface, drawn up to a fishing boat while it’s “chewing on” a hooked fish, Dr. Bolstad said. Younger specimens have turned up in trawl nets.\n\nYet until now, humans had not witnessed a colossal squid at home, swimming in the deep Antarctic sea.\n\nOne reason they’re so elusive is the sheer size of that home. Additionally, the squid are probably avoiding us, Dr. Bolstad said. “They’re very aware of their surroundings, because any disturbance in the water column around them might mean a predator.”\n\nSperm whales, the squid’s main predator, can dive up to two kilometers (1.25 miles). Perhaps to help them avoid the whales, colossal squid have evolved the world’s largest eyes — bigger than a basketball.\n\nThey also have “a unique combination of suckers and hooks on the arms and the tentacles,” Dr. Bolstad said, which is how she was able to confirm that the young sea creature in the new footage was a colossal squid.\n\nThe footage was taken by a remotely operated submersible called SuBastian, which the Schmidt Ocean Institute uses to explore the deep sea. This particular dive was a partnership with the Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census’, an initiative to discover unknown species. The submersible stopped for a few minutes on descent to film the small, transparent cephalopod.\n\n“I think it’s very exciting,” said Christine Huffard, a biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California who wasn’t involved in the expedition.\n\nDr. Huffard has used other remotely operated submersibles in her research. She said these exploratory missions have “tremendous value.” For example, her observations of octopuses walking bipedally on the ocean floor — using two arms to stroll, and the other six to possibly camouflage themselves as a clump of algae or a coconut — happened by chance. The findings have been useful to researchers in soft robotics, she said.\n\nCapturing footage of rarely seen marine animals like the colossal squid, Dr. Huffard said, can also inform decisions about human activities like deep-sea mining.\n\nShe said it would help to know where these animals spend their time, where they travel to mate or spawn, or how long they live.\n\nThe young colossal squid in the video was swimming around 600 meters down, Dr. Bolstad said, not in the deeper waters where adults likely dwell. Other deep-sea squids spend their early lives in shallower waters, she said. Having a transparent body may help the baby swim undetected by predators before it descends as an opaque, reddish adult to the darker ocean.\n\nA submersible’s camera can detect the squid — and transmit images instantaneously. Unlike the scientists of a century ago, who had to dig through partly digested carnage in a whale’s belly, anyone could watch the Schmidt “dive-stream” from home to be part of the moment of finding the colossal squid, Dr. Bolstad said. “To be able to participate in these explorations and discoveries, essentially in real time, from anywhere on the planet — that’s an amazing thing that humans can do.”\n\nShe’ll continue looking for a full-grown animal. “I can’t wait to see what a live adult colossal squid looks like, at home in the deep sea where it belongs,” she said.\n\nBut she said she was also glad that the first sighting of the species in the wild was not of the adult version — an enormous, hook-wielding leviathan, but “this beautiful early life stage that looks like a little glass sculpture.”\n\n“I actually love that this is our first glimpse of what will become a true giant,” Dr. Bolstad said.",

    "body": " Nearly 40 different kinds of common generic medications are being recalled, according to a report posted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n\n The medications, all produced by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc., were initially recalled on March 13. The FDA gave the recall a Class II risk level on April 8.\n\n\n All of the recalled drugs were manufactured at a Glenmark Pharmaceuticals factory in India, and failed to meet “current good manufacturing practice,” the FDA said.\n\n\n There were 39 different generic medications included in this recall, used to treat dozens of different conditions.\n\n\n For example, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals recalled certain lots of their Fenofibrate Capsules—these are a generic form of Tricor, a medication that lowers triglycerides and cholesterol.\n\n\n Others included medications used to treat atrial fibrillation, seizures, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure, among many others.\n\n\n Below is a full list of the Glenmark generic medications that were recalled:\n\n\n More information on recall numbers, lot numbers, and expiration dates for each recalled medication can be found in the FDA's enforcement report.\n\n\n These recalled generic medications were distributed nationwide.\n\n\n The majority of them were prescription only, so people likely got them from a pharmacy.\n\n\n However, certain lots of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals' Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen (NSAID) Tablets were distributed to Amazon and Walmart. Recalled Cetirizine Hydrochloride Tablets, used to treat seasonal allergy symptoms, were distributed by Amazon.\n\n\n All of the medications included in the recall failed to meet current good manufacturing practice standards, the FDA said.\n\n\n Following these regulations “includes establishing strong quality management systems, obtaining appropriate quality raw materials, establishing robust operating procedures, detecting and investigating product quality deviations, and maintaining reliable testing laboratories,” the FDA said.\n\n\n According to a report obtained by ProPublica, the FDA inspected the Glenmark Pharmaceuticals site in Madhya Pradesh, India back in February. They found that the company:\n\n\n All of the recalled medications have been given a Class II recall distinction.\n\n\n According to the FDA, this means they “may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” however, the \"probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.”\n\n\n The FDA’s report did not mention whether there have been any injuries or adverse events in connection to the recalled drugs. It also didn’t provide information about what the specific harm to consumers might be, beyond the fact that the drugs weren’t produced in line with current good manufacturing practices.\n\n\n However, this same Glenmark Pharmaceuticals plant in India was the subject of a ProPublica investigation last year—the manufacturer had to issue multiple recalls in 2024 due to issues with their extended-release potassium chloride medication.\n\n\n The company received reports of three deaths and three hospitalizations among patients who had taken the recalled potassium chloride drugs, though it wasn’t clear if the drug itself was to blame, according to ProPublica. There’s also federal legislation against the company which alleges that these faulty drugs were to blame for the death of a woman in Maine.\n\n\n Though the FDA didn’t offer any guidance to consumers in their recall report, anybody who has any of these recalled Glenmark Pharmaceuticals medications should stop taking them.\n\n\n In particular, people taking prescription drugs should get in touch with their physician if necessary to discuss options to access a safe version.\n\n\nFood and Drug Administration. Enforcement report: 96474.\n\nGlenmark Pharmaceuticals. Rx generic product catalog: Fenofibrate Capsules USP [Micronized].\n\nGlenmark Pharmaceuticals.

    "body": "Even though I regularly preach about the importance of mental health for your overall well-being, I have a small confession to make. I've never been to therapy. \n\nFirst things first, it's important to clarify that I don't believe in any taboos about therapy. It's an important tool for managing your mental health and can have a profound impact on your relationships with others. \n\nHowever, I've always been intimidated by starting therapy—and I've had plenty of excuses for skipping it. Therapy was out of my budget; there wasn't enough time in my schedule to meet with someone in person; switching therapists would be awkward. \n\nBut Talkspace took away my excuses. The online platform connects you with licensed professionals with options for phone, text, or live video therapy sessions. Signing up takes less than 5 minutes and even shows you what's covered by your insurance. \n\nWhen signing up for therapy was scary, Talkspace made it a lot easier. And the best part? I'm planning to stick with it long-term. Below, I'll uncover what it's like to enter your first therapy session and dive into my experience using the Talkspace platform. \n\nTalkspace is an online therapy service that offers affordable services for couples, individuals, and even teens. You can choose whether you want traditional therapy or psychiatric care. The former will connect you with licensed therapists or mental health counselors, while the latter will specialize in medication management. \n\nWhen you join, you'll be prompted to select the exact type of care you're seeking, along with sharing information about yourself. If you opt for traditional therapy, your questionnaire will focus on your current mental state with questions about how you're currently feeling. Anyone seeking psychiatric support will need to share a bit of context about their medical history to help the platform find the right fit. \n\nTalkspace kickstarts your journey by sharing potential plan options. Users can opt into using insurance or decide to pay out-of-pocket. The plan options include:\n\nA someone new to therapy, I wanted to go all in with live video. While I know that text therapy can be helpful for many, I'm someone who shows their emotions on their face (even when I'm composed with my words). Having someone watch my reactions and facial expressions felt like the best way to get the most out of my sessions.\n\nPrior to my first session, I was extremely nervous. While I knew I was vetting the therapist to ensure they were a fit for my needs—and Talkspace would let me switch out healthcare providers at any time—I didn't really know what to expect in my session (and it was 60 minutes long!).\n\nThankfully, Talkspace provided pre-session questions to help me get into the correct mindset. These questions helped me gauge what I currently felt and where I could benefit the most from support. And while I hadn't started my session yet, I loved that it provided prompts to help guide your therapist through the best way to interact with you—it's a two-way street!\n\nOnce I logged into my session, I was immediately at ease. I'd opted for a female practitioner (you have the choice!) because I felt they could best relate to my experience—and she met all of my expectations. Her presence was calming yet inquisitive, with thoughtful tidbits of knowledge woven into our conversation.\n\nThere were moments where I could tell she was trying to understand a bit more of my mental health—asking about a recent period of poor sleep and questioning how big of a role anxiety played in my life—but ultimately she allowed me to guide her through my background with ease. The session ended with my therapist providing a goal, which can later be tracked in the platform to see my progress over time.\n\nDespite my hesitation about online therapy, I was shocked that I cried at least once despite feeling like my mental health was in a great space. The session revealed how much work I'd put into trying to change habits that weren't serving me, but it also showed how much further I had to go.\n\nAnd while my rave thoughts about my session could be attributed to the power of therapy, I think the process was so simple because of Talkspace. It felt like the platform had thought of everything to make starting therapy a breeze: a cheat sheet of questions to make the most of your session, a tool to track your progress over time, and a streamlined system that makes utilizing your insurance so easy.\n\nNot only is Talkspace HIPPA-compliant, but it also uses encrypted messaging, two-factor authentication, and even biometric login options like Face ID to protect your data. And while the security is legit, so is the vetting process for therapists. \n\nTalkspace requires mental health professionals to be licensed and verified, with a background check. Additionally, they need 3,000+ hours of clinical experience to offer their services on Talkspace.  \n\nBeginning therapy isn’t just about “fixing” something. It’s a wellness practice—just like eating well or moving your body. It's a way of nourishing your inner life, developing emotional strength, and living with more intention. And for those of us who’ve never tried therapy before, Talkspace offers a soft, inviting on-ramp to that journey.\n\nBy lowering logistical barriers and providing professional, licensed support in a digital space, Talkspace meets a modern need: mental health care that’s accessible, judgment-free, and rooted in the belief that caring for your mind is as essential as caring for your body. And yes, I've already booked another session.\n\n*These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

It's one of several Xbox features launching in April.\r\n\n\n\r\nMicrosoft first discussed giving Xbox players the ability to stream their owned games back in 2019, but the feature suffered multiple delays. It finally arrived last November, but was only available through a limited number of platforms - namely TVs and via browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headset. A month later, streaming to Xbox consoles was introduced to Insider testing, and it's now available to everyone - provided they have a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, at least.\r\n\n\n\r\nThe feature's arrival means all Ultimate members can now stream games outside of those included in the Game Pass library, but only if they appear on Microsoft's list of supported titles. At present, \"100+\" games are compatibile with the feature, and more are set to be added over time. Recent additions include Lost Records: Bloom & Rage Tape 2, Wanderstop, and Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - with the full list available on the Xbox website. \r\n\n\n\r\nTo begin using the feature, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers should fire up their console and navigate to My games & apps > Full library > Owned Games. All supported titles include a cloud badge on their game page, and streaming is started by selecting the game and choosing the Play with Cloud Gaming option. It's also possible to begin streaming directly from the Store app after purchasing a compatible game.\r\n\n\n\r\nAlongside owned game streaming, April's Xbox update brings a number of other improvements and additions to console. Xbox's 'Free up space' screen, for instance, now highlights duplicate copies of games and games that players no longer have access to, and Microsoft has introduced new Game hubs to Xbox consoles too.\r\n\n\n\r\nAdditionally, Xbox remote play has seen changes, with Microsoft removing the feature from the Xbox app on mobile and instead requiring players to access it from their mobile device's browser, which the company insists will \"make it easier for our teams to optimise the streaming experience and build new features\". The change will also \"soon\" bring remote play to more devices, including Samsung Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. \r\n\n\n\r\nAnd finally, Microsoft is updating its Xbox app on iOS and Android so players can buy games and add-on content, join Game Pass, and redeem Perks directly in-app. The changes will initially be available to beta users before launching for everyone via the Google Play Store on Android devices and the Apple Store on iOS.

Instead of juggling what to uninstall next, a solid external SSD gives you room to breathe, no matter where you are. \n\nWhether it's for transporting your massive libary, or for a plug in a play experience, right now, Samsung has two 4TB options on sale that plug directly into the Ally X's USB-C ports without a fuss.\n\n$199.99 (was $358.98). Includes bonus Sonic the Hedgehog - PRO Plus microSDXC 256GB.\n\nSamsung T5 EVO 4TB, now $199.99, is down from $358.98. That's a $158.99 discount and it includes a bonus 256GB Sonic the Hedgehog microSD card with adapter, worth $33.99. The T5 EVO runs on USB 3.2 Gen 1, which pairs smoothly with the Ally X's USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port. You’ll get up to 460 MB/s transfer speeds, more than enough for launching games quickly or storing loads of media.\n\nIt’s compact and light, so it won’t weigh down your setup. Samsung says it can survive a 6-foot drop, which is handy if your idea of portable gaming involves backpacks and gravity. It also includes 256-bit AES hardware encryption, so your files are protected without needing to install extra software.\n\nIf you want to take full advantage of the Ally X's USB 4 port, look at the Samsung T9 4TB. It's one of RPS' top picks for gaming SSDs, and currently priced at $299.99, down from $439.99. It uses USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 and delivers transfer speeds up to 2,000 MB/s, which means you can run large games straight from the drive with minimal delay. Perfect for anyone treating the Ally X as a serious gaming platform, not just a handheld.\n\nT9 also manages heat well, keeping performance consistent even during longer sessions. It’s rated to survive drops from nearly 10 feet and has the same hardware encryption as the T5 EVO. You also get Samsung’s Magician software, which helps manage firmware updates and keeps tabs on drive health without extra effort.\n\nBoth SSDs are fully compatible with the Ally X, along with your PC, Android devices, consoles, and pretty much anything else with a USB-C port. If you're looking to expand your storage without slowing things down, either drive is a solid fit. The T5 EVO gives you a ton of space at a lower price. The T9 gives you raw speed to match the hardware you're working with.\n\n\n        Rock Paper Shotgun is better when you sign in\n      \n\n\n        Sign in and join us on our journey to discover strange and compelling PC games.\n      \n\n© 2025 Rock Paper Shotgun, an IGN Entertainment, Inc. brand. 18 Mansell Street Level 3, London, E1 8AA, United Kingdom.

    "body": "Pulsar made a great impression with the Xboard QS, which featured expansive physical customization and a build quality strong enough to be classified as a weapon. Along with some of my favorite mechanical switches, Pulsar proved to be a real player in the boutique (and expensive) keyboard space. The PCMK 2 HE, however, takes on a different design philosophy with a lighter, slimmer build and makes the move to magnetic switches to stand among some of the best gaming keyboards recently released. It costs a pretty penny at a base price of $160, especially considering its wired-only connectivity limits versatility, but everything else around it is fantastic and shows that Pulsar isn’t just a one-hit wonder.\n\nThe PCMK 2 HE rocks a simple design, and it’s a clean and attractive aesthetic with the black and white color scheme that contrasts really well. The QWER, ASDF, Escape, and Enter keys come in the opposite color of the rest of the keycaps (depending on which primary color you choose to buy), and the backlit Pulsar logo above the arrow keys shines brightly. That logo is also a magnetic tab that you can remove, and even get customized for a little extra. The legend on it indicates whether or not Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, or Game Mode is active via the backlighting as well.\n\nThe exposed keycaps on the aluminum top plate lets them pop and the RGB backlighting flow nicely across the board. These double-shot PBT keycaps don’t have transparent lettering so the lighting doesn’t help with visibility, but there’s a decent brightness that helps the customizable colors still jump out. The dampeners and foam layer make up the rest of the keyboard, however, the keystrokes aren’t exactly soft or quiet. I’m fine with it since the keys have a light and bouncy feel that works well for gaming and long-term typing, although it does sound more “clacky” than most other magnetic keyboards. The bottom is encased in a transparent plastic so it’s not a fully aluminum chassis and doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as it could have been, but the see-through look is pretty sweet.\n\nPulsar collaborated with Gateron for its magnetic switches, which have a really smooth linear feel – at just 30g +/- 7 on the initial actuation force, it’s one of the lightest switches I’ve used. In moving to magnetic Hall Effect switches, it affords the keyboard another layer customization that you just can’t get from mechanical keyboards. Popular manufacturers like Logitech and Razer are jumping onto it now, and Pulsar is up there with the big names not just with how well the switches themselves perform, but because of how easy it is to get the most out of them.\n\nAs with other boutique-style keyboard makers, Pulsar uses a web-based configurator instead of a downloadable software suite to customize the keyboard’s settings. It’s called Bibimbap and makes tweaking things a breeze, similar to what Keychron offers as I saw with the K4 HE that I also reviewed. You just go to the Pulsar software URL (it’ll say “download” but it doesn’t actually download a client) and select the keyboard from the Connect menu. From there, you can mess with things like the customizable actuation point, RGB lighting profile, key assignments, macros, and much more.\n\nAlmost every feature included is configurable on a per-key basis, and while RGB isn’t going to necessarily shine through the keycaps, the degree to which you tweak the color spectrum, effects, and indicator lights on the magnetic tab is extensive. Having adjustable actuation points, thanks to the magnetic switches, comes in clutch as well, and that’s simply done in the Performance tab in the software – it can be as short as 0.1mm or as deep as 4.0mm and anywhere in between in 0.1mm increments.\n\nBecause this is a magnetic keyboard with features like Rapid Trigger and Quick Tap, I do need to address the ever-present elephant in the room. Quick Tap, being the name for SOCD (simultaneous opposite cardinal direction) input in this case, is a contentious feature that allows immediate input recognition even with the opposing direction still being held. In a shooter, holding A to strafe left while tapping D to strafe right without letting go of A creates a jiggle-strafing movement that is physically impossible otherwise. And this technique makes you an extremely tough target to hit. While every magnetic keyboard has some form of SOCD now, it doesn’t mean you’re safe to use it – you will get kicked from Counter-Strike 2 matches, for example, so be mindful of that. Rapid Trigger isn’t as problematic, it just recognizes any upward movement as a reset point, making repeated tapping faster.\n\nCheck out our roundup of the best gaming mice out now!\n\nDespite not being as physically sophisticated as the Xboard QS, there is still some onboard customization you can do with the PCMK 2 HE, like swapping out the switches. If you want to change things up and ditch the Gateron x Pulsar magnetic switches, you can do that easily so long as you’re putting in N-Pole or S-Pole switches.\n\nTo cut to the chase, gaming performance on the PCMK 2 HE is stellar. That’s largely due to the super-light touch to the Gateron x Pulsar magnetic switches and the adjustable actuation points. Even without using Quick Tap, my skill ceiling in Counter-Strike 2 is a bit higher on account of being able to do quicker keystrokes and have those inputs recognized switfly. While I love the K4 HE that I mentioned earlier, I give the slight edge for gaming to something like the PCMK 2 HE since its switches make these kinds of techniques easier to execute for competitive scenarios. Whether I'm quick-strafing to peak corners, switching weapons on a dime, or crouch-jumping through a window, the PCMK 2 HE let me pull these moves off effortlessly.\n\nWhile I like having a super short actuation point for a competitive shooter, setting my keys to a deeper point works wonders for making sure I don't accidently set off the wrong action in my attack rotation for Final Fantasy XIV. As someone who spent hours-on-end raiding, I definitely felt my fingers wearing out the longer the raid went on, too, and the switches on the PCMK 2 HE helps mitigate that kind of exhaustion by virtue of the light actuation force. It's those sorts of capabilities that may seem minor on paper, but make noticeable differences in practice.\n\nWhile much of these perks are due to the magnetic switches, the keyboard is a pleasure to use even if it's louder than most of its contemporaries. That bounciness I mentioned earlier feels great when I'm typing all throughout the work day, making for a comfortable experience outside of gaming. \n\nIt’s worth noting that the PCMK 2 HE features a 8000Hz polling rate, which I’ve talked about extensively as it pertains to high-end gaming mice. With regards to keyboards, the benefits are much more limited, and I would go as far to say negligible. Where the continuous and miniscule movements of a mouse swipe come out smoother with a high polling rate, the binary nature of keyboard inputs just don't really need that. If anything, it's to give you piece of mind that you're getting the best performance that's technically possible (but let's be real, putting 8,000Hz polling rate on a box is also a marketing move).\n\nThe Pulsar PCMK 2 HE is available for $159.95 on Amazon or directly from the Pulsar store page. It comes in two color schemes – black-white keycaps with a black underplate or white-black keycaps with a white underplate.\n\nI love how much of a breeze it is to use the Pulsar PCMK 2 HE TKL – the Gateron x Pulsar magnetic switches are light to the touch making typing and quick inputs for gaming effortless. The type of customization afforded by magnetic switches come through in the easy-to-use web-based software, and that's what puts Hall Effect keyboards over mechanical ones. It's also an aesthetically pleasing plank with a clean look that isn't gaudy. Like most of Pulsar’s catalogue, it’s quite pricey for a wired-only keyboard, but there’s no doubt that you get a quality product in return. ",

    "body": "The next big Doom game, Doom: The Dark Ages, arrives next month. And to help celebrate, Xbox has announced two new Doom-themed controllers, one of which features spikes, blood, and demonic glyphs. \n\nOfficially revealed in January, Doom: The Dark Ages is a massive and awesome-looking prequel to the recent Doom games from id Software and Bethesda. The upcoming FPS is set to launch on May 15 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Dark Ages tells the tale of the Doom Slayer aka Doom Guy’s war against Hell and all the nasty monsters that call the realm home. It will feature giant mechs and dragons, and might be the coolest game I’ve seen in years. So I’m not surprised the new Xbox controller inspired by the game is also pretty dang cool. \n\nOn April 16, Xbox announced a new, limited-edition $80 Doom controller that is available now until it sells out. The controller is designed to look like the Doom Slayer’s armor, complete with some blood splatter and the Slayer’s symbol carved into the right handle. \n\nOne bit I really like about the new controller is that it features 3D spikes near the Xbox guide button. Now of course, these aren’t very big or super sharp, but it’s a nice touch that makes this feel like more than just a repaint of a standard Xbox gamepad. \n\nBeyond the new controller, Microsoft also unveiled a different Doom-themed Xbox Elite Controller that is darker and more sinister looking. That one isn’t out yet, but you can pre-order it starting today. It does cost $200, so keep that in mind. There’s also a new Xbox Series X console wrap that turns your console into a shrine dedicated to the Doom Slayer.  This is out now for $55, but is only available on the Microsoft Store. \n\nI’m very tempted to pick up that standard Xbox controller with the blood and spikes. It feels like the perfect way to play Doom: The Dark Ages when it arrives on May 15. Well, I mean the actual perfect way to play is on a PC with a keyboard and mouse, but this might be the second best way to kill demons next month. ",

Here’s how it works.\n\n\nHailee Steinfeld is eager to reprise her Hawkeye role as Kate Bishop in the MCU, and what's more, she's especially excited by the proposition of working with Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova again, following the chemistry the pair shared in the first season of Hawkeye.\n\n\"Oh my gosh. See, these get me in trouble, these questions!\" Steinfeld jokes with Collider when asked about her MCU future. \"I wish I could say it all. I wish I knew it all. I think one of the greatest parts about being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is that you yourself are along for the ride, and this is another character that I love so, so, so much and understand. I'm so grateful that Kate is a character that is so widely loved. I, as a fan, am so excited to see where she goes and to be a part in any and every way that is in store for her.\"\n\nStill, Steinfeld didn't shy away from calling out her \"powerhouse\" co-star Pugh, whose Yelena Belova has gone on to be a central part of this summer's Thunderbolts* film.\n\n\"She's wonderful. I would do anything to work more with Florence, especially in the Kate and Yelena world. I think we'd have a lot of fun,\" Steinfeld says. \"Florence came in, and we had these scenes that were very heavy on the dialogue, and so we got right to work with the dynamic and how we could make it sort of flow as best as it could. We hit it off immediately, and we just had the best time together.\"\n\nPugh is proving herself as a tremendously capable actor as well as action star, with Thunderbolts* featuring a stunt in which Pugh herself actually leaps off the second highest skyscraper in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the final trailer for Thunderbolts* centers directly on Yelena's character arc as a hero, culminating in her potentially repeating the fateful sacrifice of her sister Natasha Romanoff.\n\nAs for Steinfeld's Kate Bishop, she was last seen in The Marvels in a scene in which she is recruited into an apparent Young Avengers team by Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel.\n\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\n\nThunderbolts* will hit theaters on May 2.

    "body": "The ‘Apple’ dance was added to Roblox to coincide with a Dress to Impress update\n\nKelley Heyer, an actor and TikTok content creator, has sued Roblox over the usage and sale of her copyrighted dance to “Apple” by pop star Charli XCX — a dance that went viral on TikTok and even became a part of Charli XCX’s live show. Heyer filed the lawsuit in California on April 11, alleging that she and Roblox were in negotiations to officially license the dance in Roblox; however, Roblox released the emote before negotiations were finalized, and they never came to pass.\n\nRoblox added the dance emote in mid-August, coinciding with a Dress to Impress update that added everything Brat (Charli XCX’s summer hit album) to the game on Aug. 17. Heyer first posted the “Apple” dance on June 15, 2024 and submitted a copyright application for it on Aug. 30. That was after Roblox contacted her to license the dance, which came after Charli XCX’s label contracted Roblox to get the artist in Dress to Impress. Heyer said she was willing to license the dance on Aug. 12, per the lawsuit. But the dance was released before the negotiations were finalized. Heyer said in the lawsuit that Roblox has “refused to finalize a license agreement” and to compensate Heyer for her dance.\n\n“Roblox moved forward using Kelley’s IP without a signed agreement,” attorney Miki Anzai said in a statement to Polygon. “Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement.”\n\nThe “Apple” dance is no longer available for sale on Roblox — it was sold until November 2024. Heyer said in the lawsuit that Roblox sold “in excess of 60,000 units of the Apple Dance emote” and earned “an estimated $123,000” in sales. “As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole ‘artist’ for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer,” lawyers wrote in the complaint.\n\nHeyer’s “Apple” dance was licensed correctly in Fortnite, added in December and sold as an emote. Heyer said Netflix has licensed its usage, too. Heyer is looking to the court to award her Roblox’s profits on the dance, as well as other damages. Epic Games has been sued several times in the past over its usage of popular or viral dances as emotes in the battle royale game; five lawsuits were dismissed in 2019, including one filed by Fresh Prince of Bel-Air actor Alfonso Ribeiro.\n\nOne of the more recent lawsuits, filed by choreographer Kyle Hanagami, was dismissed and appealed; the 9th Circuit reversed the dismissal and revived the argument that “reducing choreography to ‘poses’ would be akin to reducing music to just ‘notes,’” per the appeals court. Both sides agreed to dismiss the lawsuit in 2024. It’s now quite common for Epic Games to license dances, like Heyer’s “Apple” dance, for inclusion in Fortnite.\n\nReached for comment, a Roblox spokesperson issued the following statement to Polygon:\n\n“As a platform powered by a community of creators, Roblox takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform. Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court.”\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include a comment from a Roblox spokesperson and Heyer’s attorney.",

Arcane Season 1's 4K Limited Edition Steelbook is on sale for only $30 (was $60). The 50% discount is the best deal since Arcane's Blu-ray release in October. Amazon is also offering a steep discount on the 1080p Blu-ray release featuring a different steelbook case, but the 4K version is actually cheaper right now.\n\nArcane's 4K Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook features Jinx cover art and is on sale for $30, down from $60. This edition comes with three 4K discs and a standard Blu-ray disc with special features.\n\nArcane Season 1's physical editions include the full nine-episode arc and three hours of special features. Fans can go behind the scenes of Arcane with exclusive conversations involving key creative talent and writers, numerous scene breakdowns from the animation staff at studio Fortiche, making-of videos, and more.\n\nAs mentioned, the standard 1080p Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook costs over five bucks more than the 4K Limited Edition, so if you have a device capable of playing 4K Blu-rays, you'll certainly want to opt for the 4K release.\n\nBut the $20 discount here is nice for those who want to own both steelbooks, as the standard Blu-ray Limited Edition Steelbook features Vi, Jinx's sister.\n\nIf you have no interest in steelbook cases, you can buy the standard edition Arcane Blu-ray with cover art displaying many characters from the show for $31.49 (was $45).\n\nBoth 1080p Blu-ray sets include three discs and the same three hours of special features as the 4K edition.\n\nThis 224-page art book has been surprisingly difficult to find in stock since its release in December, but Amazon and Walmart have copies available right now. The hardcover book comes with an acetate dust jacket with exclusive artwork shown above. The cover itself inverses the illustration's color scheme.\n\nAlong with never-before-seen concept art, the book contains over 20 interviews with key team members who created the show.\n\nA Kindle ebook version is also available to purchase for only $19.\n\nWith elaborate and imaginative animation, production on the sequel series took a long time, but the second and final season did eventually make its way to Netflix in November. The streamer released the nine episodes of Season 2 in three acts (three episodes per week). It's unclear at this time if Season 2 will receive a Blu-ray release.\n\nSet in the League of Legends universe--the massively popular video game franchise developed by Riot Games--Arcane follows iconic League champions Vi and Jinx as they get caught up in the power struggles between the utopian city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun. The show debuted back in 2021 to critical acclaim for its storytelling, incredible animation, and getting that one Imagine Dragons song stuck in your head for several months.\n\nMore Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders\n\nGot a news tip or want to contact us directly?

    "body": "The 2000 sketch's co-writer, Michael Schur, joked that \"30 Rock would have crumbled to the ground\" had the cameo worked out.\n\n Tom Cruise nearly took a Saturday Night Live sketch featuring his Top Gun costar Val Kilmer from memorable to iconic with a surprise cameo appearance. That sketch's co-writer, Michael Schur, now explains why he didn't.\n\n\n In a voice note sent to Seth Meyers, which the late night host played on a recent episode of The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers Podcast, Schur reminisced about Kilmer's stint hosting the Dec. 9, 2000, episode of the sketch comedy program, characterizing the actor as \"very intense but very nice,\" before describing the sketch in question, which was co-written by Robert Carlock.\n\n\n \"It was 25 years after the events of Top Gun and Iceman (Kilmer's character's nickname in the film) had retired from the Navy and was now flying very boring commercial flights for Delta,\" Schur described the premise. Indeed, the sketch, starring Chris Parnell, Will Ferrell, and Ana Gasteyer, sees Kilmer battling Parnell for control of the intercom, shouting out incoherent, adrenaline-fueled demands, and barking movie quotes like, \"Listen to me, you're out of line! Your ego's writing checks your body can't cash and that makes you dangerous!\"\n\n\n According to Schur, Cruise was in the building that night, and very nearly walked into the final seconds of the sketch — but it didn't happen.\n\n\n Schur remembered Cruise \"standing eight feet away watching this sketch and just enjoying it a great deal. [Longtime SNL producer Marci Klein] came over to me while the sketch was airing and was like, Tom Cruise is here, should we get him to like walk on? I was like, 'Yes of course, we should.' And she was like, 'What should he do?'\"\n\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n\n The future co-creator and showrunner of Parks and Recreation suggested that Cruise walk on in the sketch's final moments to \"grab Val Kilmer and just say, 'Hey Iceman, let's get you out of here, bud.'\"\n\n\n Klein went over and told Cruise, and to Schur's memory, he \"saw Tom Cruise nodding... like, 'Yeah, yeah, okay I get it.' I was like, 'Oh my God, this is going to be incredible.'\"\n\n\n Schur said he watched Cruise head toward the stage, but it was too late. \"The sketch ended and the applause was cued and Val got whisked away to run to change. We missed it by like eight seconds. We missed a Tom Cruise walk-on into the sketch, which would have just, 30 Rock would have crumbled to the ground.\"\n\n\n With or without a Cruise cameo, Kilmer's turn hosting Saturday Night Live is still remembered fondly.\n\n\n The legendary actor died of pneumonia on April 2 at the age of 65. During the April 5 episode, hosted by Jack Black, an image of Kilmer flashed onscreen just before the closing goodbye.\n\n\n Known for his intensity and seeming self-seriousness, Kilmer surprised audiences with his willingness to parody more than just his Top Gun role on the 2000 episode. He also poked fun at his role as The Doors frontman Jim Morrison in the 1991 film named after the band, and even took a swing at politician Jeb Bush in another sketch featuring Gasteyer.\n\n\n At a promotional event for Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning at CinemaCon last week, Cruise paid tribute to Kilmer by asking the audience to join him in a moment of silence. \"Thank you, Val,\" he concluded. \"I wish you well on your next journey.\"\n\n\n Listen to more memories with SNL and MacGruber colleagues John Solomon and Will Forte on The Lonely Island and Seth Meyers podcast above.\n",

    "body": "Although none of the live-action Spider-Man spinoff films that Sony Pictures has released outside the Marvel Cinematic Universe have been particularly well-received, Kraven the Hunter became the laughingstock of superhero cinema in 2024. Beyond the fact that the film had been pushed back several times, it became obvious that the attempt to turn Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s version of Sergei Nikolaevich Kravinoff into a ruthless anti-hero was doomed from the start. While it was a massive financial disappointment when it first debuted in theaters, Kraven the Hunter has managed to find a new audience on Netflix, who may have benefited from the lowered expectations. While it is certainly not a piece of cinematic art in the vein of Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, Kraven the Hunter has some refreshingly nasty, brutal action sequences that give it some entertainment value.\n\nKraven the Hunter is one of the few films based on Marvel Comics to receive an R-rating, and essentially treats itself like a violent B-movie. While the Deadpool franchise was just as violent, the level of tongue-in-cheek jokes made it very hard to become shocked by any of the graphic dismemberments; on the flip side, Logan was more of an emotional character drama about aging and accepting loss, and the action scenes were only secondary. Kraven the Hunter accepts the flimsiness of its story, as it's not that far into the film that Taylor-Johnson is ruthlessly dispatching with poachers and brawling with Russian mobsters. The self-seriousness of the material leads to some inadvertent comedy; Taylor-Johnson does not seem to be concerned about looking ridiculous when he is on all fours biting people, even when the visual effects don’t look entirely rendered. At times, the film’s violence is so over-the-top that it ventures into body horror territory.\n\nMatt’s quick deductions are suddenly lacking the realism we’ve come to expect from the character.\n\nKraven the Hunter’s action benefits from a cast that seems to be “in on the joke,” and are willing to give heightened performances that reflect the inherently ridiculous nature of the material. While Paul Giamatti was infamously quite over-the-top when he appeared as the Rhino in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Alessandro Nivola’s depiction of the same character is so completely campy that it makes Giamatti’s work look as subtle as a Daniel Day-Lewis performance in comparison. Nonetheless, Fred Hechinger is actually able to give an emotionally engaging performance, as the bond between his character, Dmitri, and Kraven is very impactful. The chase sequence in which Kraven must save Dmitri shows that the film was interested in developing genuine character motivations. It's also a rather entertaining scene that refuses to acknowledge the rampant collateral damage that has been caused by the events of the film.\n\n While recent disappointing superhero movies can be nearly unwatchable due to how centered they were on providing Easter eggs and teasing future films, Kraven the Hunter has a relatively straightforward story that is easy to follow. While knowledge of the source material may help explain some of the more ridiculous characters’ powers, the film has more in common with revenge thrillers of the ‘80s like Commando and Rambo: First Blood II than it does with the modern era of superhero cinema. Given that the box office receipts have indicated that there’s no chance that there will ever be a sequel, Kraven the Hunter becomes more fun to watch because its only intent is to give the audience a wild, ridiculously good time. Even if the visuals are rather bland, director J.C. Chandor was able to clearly outline what each of the characters’ abilities were, leading to some genuinely creative action scenes.\n\nKraven the Hunter is the most successful of Sony’s Spider-Man spinoffs in terms of pure entertainment; while Morbius and Madame Web were so plagued by reshoots and dull moments of exposition that they felt like chores to watch, Kraven the Hunter provides a great deal of violent mayhem that rests on the flimsiest of logic. While those expecting a deeply nuanced elevation of the original source material may have been underwhelmed, anyone looking to spend two hours on Netflix having a good time is unlikely to be completely disappointed by Kraven the Hunter.\n\nWe want to hear from you!

    "body": "\n\tDirector Bernard MacMahon talks about making the movie with cooperation, but no control or interference, from a legendary band that trusted the filmmakers to get the band's origin story told right (and told loud).\n\n\n\tThere hasn’t been any shortage of music documentaries on big screens lately, but most are presented as special events that come in and out for one or two nights on a weekend, without settling in for a regular run. The Sony Classics release “Becoming Led Zeppelin,” though, has defied expectations of what a modern rock doc can do in cinemas, on its way to finding the favor of fans as a home video hit, too. Its success is, well, highly becoming.\n\n\n\tDirector Bernard MacMahon sat down with Variety to talk about the long process of making and then finding a buyer for the film, admitting there were plenty of companies that turned it down. The objections were plentiful, as he recalls it, when he and producer Allison McGourty were touring executive suites. But maybe most curious of all, to those who didn’t get the film, is that it doesn’t follow a traditional “VH1 Behind the Music” rise, fall and embattled rebirth narrative. “Becoming Led Zeppelin” is a rise-and-rise story, climaxing with the recording of “Led Zeppelin II.” If someone wanted to make a movie about how things got bigger and more out of control later on, they were welcome to it, but MacMahon knew how Zeppelin changed the music world at their outset was more than enough to fill two gratifying hours. And sending music lovers out of the world’s theaters happy and humming (to the extent that anyone can hum “Bron-Yr-Aur”) is a byproduct of the decision to focus on a celebratory but still revelatory origin story.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tVIP+\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Ghibli-Style AI Wake-Up Call\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisney's 'Tangled' Live-Action Movie on Hold Indefinitely\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe signs were good in February when the foc grossed $2.6 million in its first weekend, playing a limited run on Imax screens — the best number ever for an Imax music film — before crossing over to regular cinemas. By the first week of April, the film had grossed $10 million domestically and more than $12 million worldwide, rare territory for a documentary. Now, fans everywhere are re-streaming the home release and trying to tweak their speakers to make it sound as good as it did in state-of-the-art theaters… though MacMahon stresses that he only wanted to make the film sound as good as the original pressing of “Led Zeppelin II” did roaring out of mere stereo speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tPopular on Variety\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did the idea to do a movie focused on the rise of Led Zeppelin come from?\n\n\n\tWay back, my mom was an antique dealer, and when I had just turned 12, one of her boxes had this paperback book in it called “Led Zeppelin” (“The Led Zeppelin Biography,” by Ritchie Yorke, published in 1976). It was quite beat-up then, but it was published in in the mid-‘70s, covering the early part of their career — the first (long-form) thing that had been written about them. I didn’t have any idea who they were, but I found the story completely fascinating and inspiring.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWhen children have something they want to do, there can be something that inspires that that might be useful; it could be paintings, could be anything. And what the story was about to me was these kids that had this passion for music and somehow they managed to protect that light against all the odds, while constantly fueling it. And I just was very inspired by the fact that they didn’t appear to waste a minute, whether it was Jimmy Page or John Paul Jones as teenagers getting into the session world, working like demons, checking out what the recording engineers are doing, trying to figure out how this thing worked. All of them were constantly doing that, pushing themselves out there. Then when they finally all meet in the rehearsal room, they recognize, with all the stuff they’ve already done, that this this is a special thing. And it felt to me that the story was like one of those Jason and the Argonauts or Odyssey or Arthur stories, where you suddenly call all the skills of these strangers together. With all of your knowledge and focus, you’ve got to be open to collaboration, to working with other people.\n\n\n\tSo I found the story super inspiring, even though I hadn’t heard the music. When my mum saw me reading it a second time, she pointed out that there was this guy that used to buy antiques from us; he would always be trying to buy my mother’s fireplace, and he’d be asking me how I was doing at school and stuff like that. We didn’t know who he was until my dad saw him sort of ditching into the silver Rolls Royce he parked around the corner … it was Peter Grant (Zeppelin’s manager), coming into our house. So I had this connection with the story. I think a few weeks after reading it a couple of times, I went and started to explore the music. And I was listening to it knowing what had gone into the music. A year or so on, I remember thinking that the perception of this band is not the perception that I have. I was hearing that the drummer was into these African American soul and jazz rhythms, as was the bass player, and it was this very interesting fusion of people. And I thought, this is, in some ways, a misunderstood group.With this film coming out, I discovered that that little book I read went out of print very shortly after it came out, and it’s been completely forgotten. And all the things that have been written about them were all written quite some time after the demise of the group, written looking back, where this was from a perspective near the beginning, looking forward. And in cinema, for the most part, those are the exciting stories — the things that are looking forward.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tSo when we finished our “American Epic” films [an acclaimed three-part documentary about recording techniques for rural artists in the early 20th century], I spoke to my producer, Allison, who came to really kind of drive it. I said, “I think this is the next story I’d like to do.” So it really came from the heart. It was something I genuinely had this affection for, and it’d been meaningful for me as a kid. These guys had never done a (documentary) film. And apart from a quote here or there that Jimmy might do when some albums are being reissued, they never talk about this. And so I thought, this is a story that’s never been done.\n\n\nWhat were the first steps you took after that point of conception?\n\n\n\tWe spent maybe seven, eight months absolutely working, researching the story, writing a script of the story, and trying to find things that hadn’t been seen before. Then we reached out to the group. After all that work, a couple of people said, “You are insane. They’ve never agreed to a film, they never will, and you just wasted your time.” We just ignored that and said, “We’ll just do it.” When you have something you think has got value or a higher purpose… The amazing thing about it was, I never actually thought about the success of the film. It’s come as this amazing surprise, because I never thought about commerciality or money at all. I just loved the story and thought: Can it inspire people, if we can get that on the screen? So it was only when the film came out and, oh my God, we became Imax’s biggest music film of all time that I was like, What?\n\n\n\tWhen we brought the film to the band, we met with Jimmy Page first. So I’m arriving at this hotel with this enormous storyboard and we sit down, and… there is a quote about how fortune favors the prepared. And as Jimmy came in, it transpired that he was a big fan of “American Epic” — he had the book and he had the soundtrack album. I think it was seven hours of presenting to him, walking through this storyboard — with trick questions he would throw out. He’d be like, “What was the name of Robert’s first band?” And I’d answer and he’d be like, “Very good. Carry on.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tI said how we wanted to shoot the film, and what was amazing is, this group that says no to everything and is known for being super private, when we actually came into that world and were really prepared and able to explain what we wanted to do, they were like, “OK, go ahead and make it.” They gave us complete artistic freedom to make the film — no control at all.\n\n\nThese days, literally almost every other documentary about a music act has that artist as executive producer. So them not exerting control is kind of unheard of, in contemporary times.\n\n\n\tYeah. Sometimes, someone will say, “Oh, you’re not covering all the groupies” and stuff like that. But we talked about one of the reasons for doing this period in the film is that it’s when they’re climbing Everest in a storm. Whatever the goal is, you’ve got that journey that is unique in human beings, whichever group or individual is making that journey in the moment. If you do land on the moon or you do get the gold record, unfortunately thereafter the story becomes very similar to that of a number of other people. But always the exciting part, or the part that’s helpful, is: This is how you do it. Or at least that’s the film I wanted to make. And I’d never seen a film that showed you how you do it.\n\n\n\tAnd it’s so funny because the film was literally pretty much frame-by-frame written before I met them. When I was going through that huge storyboard with them, all they did was say, “Oh, I’ve got a picture of that…” And it’s true that if you were making that film with other people, they would be controlling that film in its narrative completely. But they all opened up their address books or gave us telephone numbers of people they’d grown up with, knowing that those people would introduce us to everyone else, and they gave those people the blessing to talk to us.\n\n\nAnd so you did end up talking with these scores of people who knew them. But you didn’t include any conversations in the film other than what you filmed with the three surviving band members. If you just did all those other interviews for research, weren’t you ever tempted to break with the format and put anyone else on-screen as a talking head?\n\n\n\tAbsolutely zero temptation. Not one thing came up that made me think, “Oh, I wish we could put him in it,” and I’ll tell you why. For one, these guys had never talked before, and I could tell when I sat down with them, they were talking really openly. When I presented the (plan for the) film to them, they were seeing all the stuff we’d unearthed in pictures and clips they hadn’t seen before, and they were coming out with all this stuff because they felt comfortable talking to us. And I tho0ught, if I can get that on the screen, this is something special. … If I thought there was someone who was absolutely needed to give a perspective on what I was hearing and seeing, then I would’ve considered it. But what the 175 background interviews did was, firstly, reinforced to me that (the band members) were reliable witnesses, certainly of that period of their lives from their childhood forward.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnd, you know, nobody’s getting any younger, and I’ve got these guys that are still sharp, have got good memories. You know, it’s so much easier to make a film with other people talking or narrators because you can prop up all these tricky bits of narrative. But here they’re on the spot and they have to tell their story in real time, and they don’t have an opportunity to go back and reconsider the past, you know? So the key is whether it takes five or six or even seven hours, you’ve gotta go through it in one hit. If you do this, the audience has this opportunity to really understand who these people are, because I found them reliable and super candid as weaknesses of what happened.\n\n\n\tFor me, the dream is, you (in the audience) get to spend two hours with these people. Those the guys I’ve met, with the right balance of energy, wistfulness, pathos, emotion… That’s the balance I encountered. So I’m trying to put that on the screen. The received wisdom had been that they will never talk. So if you get the chance to do it, you should be having this pure distillation of what they’re about in their own words. Because what it’s many years from now — I hope — that they pass on, there’ll only be talking heads to talk about that.\n\n\nWhat are some of the best reactions you’ve gotten to the film?\n\n\n\tTaj Mahal said, “This film rearranged my molecules.” And I think it was Bob Weir who said something like, “Oh, they’re like the John Coltrane trio with a singer.” So these guys were completely getting what this thing was.\n\n\nYou first showed the film, or a rough cut, at the Venice Film Festival in 2021. But in an interview Robert Plant did when he was touring with Alison Krauss last summer, he was asked about it and said he’d only seen bits and pieces, so he was apparently in no hurry to see that rough cut. Do you know if he’s seen it by now?\n\n\n\tHe came to a theater in Waterloo with his family and grandchildren and watched it as a punter. He might have come in disguise. I heard they watched it as a family. And I don’t know how much I would say specifically, but what I heard was that he thought it was absolutely wonderful and very, very moving. And I heard that Jimmy really loved it.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film was about 15 minutes longer when you showed it in Venice, right?\n\n\n\tWhen we started editing this film, the pandemic had kicked in, and so we were not able to screen the film in its rough-cut state anywhere and weren’t allowed to assemble people in a theater. So Venice was an opportunity for us to sit in a large theater and watch the film and figure out what we needed to cut. I like sitting in audiences, particularly audiences where there’s a large number of people that are either neutral or very unfamiliar with the subject. And to have that stress of being in that room, because it gives me a very acute eye of what’s on the string. There’s a strange energy moment where people are like, “Oh, what is this?” I love fans of things, but we do not get that with a group of people that love the thing.\n\n\n\tAnd so we put it on in Venice and they were cool. We announced it after the festival tickets had all sold because I didn’t want the hardcore Zeppelin fans — not because they’re not terrific, but it wouldn’t have helped me. Venice was very much a work in progress. Unbeknownst to us, there was a press screening of the film in some theater where the PA wasn’t working and it was like, what the hell? So I think we had three or four people that reviewed that cut, and of course, we hadn’t sold the film or anything yet.\n\n\n\tYou don’t have any of that normal politics where you have this subject coming in saying, “He’s got more lines than me!” We had zero of that. And so you’ve got this thing whereyou’re going, “This is entirely down to us if this film works or not.” You can’t blame anyone else when you’ve got total freedom to do what you want. So in my world, that put a huge amount of pressure to make it the best it could be.\n\n\nWas there a key for you to making the film succeed in cinematic terms?\n\n\n\tThis film is employing all these old Hollywood musical techniques as you watch it. I’m big into the history of film, going back to the teens and the silent era, and I think I’m always returning back to when the medium I’m working in was being codified, when it was being shaped, because that’s the moment when the new ideas happen.\n\n\n\tI learned from the classic musicals of MGM and “Oklahoma!” and all these things. It’s like, let the music always carry the story forward. So you think, well, how would you do that, if the Led Zeppelin songs in album one and two were not written for a musical? But the songs do drive the narrative if you actually watch the film a couple of times. You’ll start to spot how, when they’re playing in Europe and these kids are putting their fingers in their ears and no one gets what they’re doing, they’re singing “Communication Breakdown.” When they’re flying out to New York to try and get their record deal, they’re singing “Your Time is Gonna Come.” When they’re traveling across America, and recording the second album, for a significant portion of that you are hearing “Ramble On.” And when Rolling Stone and some of the media have completely lambasted them, and they decide to kind of double down in the face of that, they’re playing “Dazed and Confused.” So the songs are used the way that they do in the ‘40s with musicals like “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” where it was compiled with different Irving Berlin songs from different musicals and they just used the lyrics to create a new narrative. That’s part of the fabric in Old Hollywood musical style fabric in this film.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you have a sense now of why it’s so popular with audiences, beyond what you anticipated?\n\n\n\tI just met with Warren Ellis from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and he’d seen it twice already, and I just run into everyday people who are watching this a number of times. And I think it’s partly the sound of the film they’re responding to. It’s got this really open sound. It’s even better if it’s got the best speakers. But even though it was made for these huge screens, it actually should be hugely effective (at home). The 5.1 mix is like the base mix, and then you just adjust it for Imax, you know. But the real base mix for these things is stereo. These recordings are mono and stereo in many ways. So it should be pretty powerful even there.\n\n\nIn another interview you said you really did not want the movie to have compressed sound. “Brickwalling” is kind of the bugaboo of audiophiles who hate everything just being turned up and pushed together, who miss having dynamics in the sound.\n\n\n\tModern films now are heavily compressed, which means for me that they can be very tiring on the ear. In terms of sound almost all the things that are normally done in film, we are not doing them in this movie. If you look at the wave forms of this, it’s really dramatic peaks and troughs. We obviously had access, potentially, to the master tapes of the studio recordings and the digital remasterings that have come out over the years. But I chose, looking at all these options, to go with the original discs.\n\n\n\tBecause when you make a record, certainly in the ‘60s, a quarter inch master would be made … it would then go to someone like a Robert Ludwig who would cut that production master onto the vinyl that you hear… And in the case of Robert Ludwig on the second Led Zeppelin album, he did radical things to the sound to make that music pop even more; he did things that are so extraordinary, you can’t get back and recreate what he did, because he’s doing it in real time. He is doing this stuff as this needle is cutting it onto a lacquer. And so that Robert Ludwig cut of that record, that’s what ignited the excitement in America. Once those masters’ plates have worn out, someone else comes in and recuts the record. In this case, Robert Ludwig had cut that record so loud, and the loudness affects how dramatically the grooves are cut… The problem was that if you had very cheap record players, that needle moving like crazy could sometimes jump out of the groove. So the record was recut at considerably less volume and with less energy. So those first 250,000 copies, pristine copies of those are recognized as being the pinnacle of how “Zeppelin II” sounds. That’s the ultimate. There’s a reason that people who knew what that thing was and how to identify that particular plastic would pay three and a half, even $4,000 if you would find a pristine copy of it.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tWe are literally doing zero to that record apart from handing it onto the speaker system. You are hearing it in the purest form, which also means no compression other than any compression that might have been applied for artistic reasons or whatever during the recording itself. So it’s the sound equivalent of me cutting a pineapple off a tree in a waku and literally slicing it in half and putting it on your plate. That’s what you are hearing. Sonically we are not tampering with the sound in any way. There might have been a couple instances where it was a live recording and there was clearly something lacking in the amount of bottom end they had. But essentially the policy was, if you think this group is worth sitting in a room for two hours listening to, bloody play their music and don’t mess with it, you know? Don’t fuck with the music. The best thing I can do as a filmmaker is give you these guys as directly and as openly as I can.\n\n\n\tOf course, the other reason why I did it that way is that when you hear the music that preceded Led Zeppelin, whether it’s Lonnie Donegan or Little Richard or Shirley Bassey, those things that they played on, those are the original discs too. And so you are hearing the exact sound of ‘63, ‘64, ‘65, ‘68. So when you’re in that theater, and they come on and they play that song in Denmark, everyone in the theater hears that huge sonic shift that’s inherent in that recording. We’re not goosing that. We’ve obviously got the purest version of that, but when they appear, you hear the difference between them and the Johnny Burnett Trio. When you get “Zeppelin 1,” Zeppelin are one of the architects of genuine live stereo recording in the studio, where the drum kit is spread across the whole left and right, panned across the whole stereo system. You hear that shift sonically, and then when you get to “Zeppelin II,” Jimmy, with the help of Eddie Kramer, is really pushing the boundaries of what you can do with stereo, with essentially a live group with some guitar and other overdubs… So amongst all the other journeys — the personal, the emotional — the other journey is you’re on a sound journey in your house, on your headphones or your speaker system…\n\n\n\tPeople can feel when you’ve done that. They don’t have to be technically minded at all. I’ve talked to women, especially, who may not have been that into the band, and their take on everything they’ve seen is as sophisticated as mine is… I’ve had some people going, “We thought it was just gonna be this completely overwhelming, distorted onslaught from this heavy rock band, and it’s not that at all.” You’re inside the music, you know? And you want to welcome people in. The whole thing about this film is sharing stuff.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve said Sony Classics was the only company that was interested in picking up the film. You must feel vindicated by the performance the film has had in theaters. Why do you think people didn’t necessarily see the value of it across the board when you were trying to sell it?\n\n\n\tIt’s kind of understandable to me is that if you are doing something that’s different, as Jimmy said, you are gonna have a lot of people that don’t get it, and what that tells me is that you’ve either got something that’s a terrible mistake or you’ve got something that may have some real potential legs to it. You’ve got to have a bit of a gut of iron to deal with these people going, “I don’t get it. It’s never gonna work.” And you’ve got to have conviction like Zeppelin did, because nobody in Britain wanted to sign them. No one wanted to book them, so “let’s go to America.” But if you can have the confidence in what you would like to see,  — but also what the 13-year-old me would like to see, and what the 13-year-old Alison will like — there may be actually thousands and thousands of people out there that feel the same way you do.\n\n\n\tIn this case, some of these executives just could not get the idea around how anyone would want to watch a music film in which they were singing whole songs. And they were like, “Where are the talking heads? Where’s the historians? Where’s the music writers?”  And the main thing about particularly rock music films is they’re always focusing completely not on how the music’s made. You’re dealing with a subject where people might have, in this case, been listening to this music for 55 years, and these (subjects) can actually tell you what it is and how they did it and emotionally how they got to that place and what they’re trying to do.\n\n\n\tThe normal thing in music documentaries is whizzing through that to get to where they’re telling you about all the problems they had a few years down the line when the thing became a business, and they’re on their fifth album and it’s just this industrial process. OK, that’s kind of mildly interesting, but it’s like, if you are a kid, that doesn’t help you with anything. Focusing on the Eagles’ issues with bad blood between the members and lots of drugs in 1977 — what does that really tell you, as a kid? I don’t think that helps to understand life and the human condition or how you might do something.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAnd so I think anything that’s changing the paradigm of how you present something — and I think this film is not done in a style that I’ve seen before, in a historical archive music film — if you’re doing it right, it’s breaking some ground in that regard. … I look back now and I go, yeah, if there’d been everyone getting it, what you would’ve had is something that I don’t think that would’ve ignited the level of interest in the public that it has, because they’d go, “Oh yeah, that ticks all the boxes of what we’re used to.” You see tht with Zeppelin, from the audiences watching at the beginning, before they find their audience. There’s a bunch of people that are like, “What the hell is this?”\n\n\n\tAnd they really didn’t have a lot of their peers liking their music, even. They weren’t championed by any of the big groups at the time, because they were breaking the mold. One of the things that’s interesting about Zeppelin is that after they’ve climbed this musical mountain that the film depicts, which concludes in 1970, they sort of — symbolically, I suppose — knocked the Beatles off the No. 1 spot. Zeppelin is the only of the big groups that emerge in the late ‘60s and ‘70s that literally has no Beatles in it whatsoever. And that is unique from every other group, because they were so pervasive. But in the DNA of Led Zeppelin, there is no Beatles whatsoever. And that’s interesting. After eight years of the Beatles being the biggest group in the world, or that long in Britain, certainly, and a bit less in America, at that point, without knowing it, the audience wanted something completely different. That’s not a pejorative thing against the Beatles, but it’s one of the reasons why I think the media had a difficult time with them early on, because it was sonically coming completely from somewhere else.\n\n\nBeyond all that alchemy, you were really attracted to the idea of portraying hard work and drive, not something so mystic or serendipitous.\n\n\n\tThe last thing I would say about this is that most films deal with compartmentalizing things that do really well as, “Oh, it’s genius.” And I look at genius like a pejorative term. Because it’s essentially saying your forehead was touched by some spiritual force, and while other people work, you were given this thing. Actually, what this film is about is you’re not given this thing; you have to work really hard at it, and nothing is handed to you on a plate, and you’ve gotta get out there and meet people and interact and do all these things. I think that that the difference of this film and other films that I’ve seen is that you start from this point where these kids are no different from you. You see Jimmy on that little TV show where his mum managed to get him up, and he just barely played two chords when it comes to solo. He just jiggles around a bit and whistles; he can’t play a lead line yet. At that point you see a kid that is literally just at the most simple level of competency, doing his thing, and John is tapping this one little snare and cymbal with his brother strumming away on the guitars. Those guys are like you, but the difference is that they keep at it.",

    "body": "An AC/DC \"High Voltage\" pop-up store will open later this week in Los Angeles.\n\nMeet fellow fans, discover legendary tour props, and snag exclusive merchandise — including limited-edition vinyl you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThursday, April 17 from noon to 10 p.m.Friday, April 18 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nAC/DC kicked off its North American tour on April 10 at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nAC/DC — guitarist Angus Young, vocalist Brian Johnson, rhythm guitarist Stevie Young, drummer Matt Laug and bass player Chris Chaney — is performing in 13 stadiums coast to coast this spring. This run will conclude on May 28 in Cleveland, Ohio at Huntington Bank Field. Along the way, they will play some of the most iconic and historic stadiums in the world, including the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on April 18 and Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois on May 24. Support on the trek is coming from THE PRETTY RECKLESS.\n\nAC/DC played the 24th and final concert of its \"Power Up\" European tour on August 17, 2024 at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nThe \"Power Up\" European tour marked AC/DC's first with the band's new touring lineup consisting of Johnson, Angus and Stevie Young, Laug and the latest addition to the group's touring lineup, Chaney.\n\nThe European tour was the first run of gigs since AC/DC's return to the stage at last year's Power Trip festival in Indio, California.\n\nAC/DC's last tour took place in 2015 and 2016 and had a $180 million gross, with 2,310,061 sold tickets reported to the Pollstar box office.\n\nLaug is an American drummer who has played with many bands/artists such as Alanis Morissette, Alice Cooper, SLASH'S SNAKEPIT and Vasco Rossi. Matt moved to Los Angeles after graduating from South Florence High School in 1986 and after attending college in L.A., Matt became a sought-after studio drummer.\n\nIn 2001, Laug supported AC/DC as part of SLASH'S SNAKEPIT on the North American and European legs of the \"Stiff Upper Lip\" tour.\n\nIn its announcement about Laug's addition to the band's Power Trip lineup, AC/DC offered no explanation for the absence of the band's longtime drummer Phil Rudd, who rejoined AC/DC for the recording of the group's comeback album, \"Power Up\", which came out in November 2020.\n\nRudd was ousted from AC/DC when he was sentenced to eight months of home detention by a New Zealand court in 2015 after pleading guilty to charges of threatening to kill and drug possession. He was replaced on the band's \"Rock Or Bust\" tour by Chris Slade, who had previously served as AC/DC's drummer between 1989 and 1994, playing on the album \"The Razor's Edge\".\n\nRudd, who appeared on all but three of AC/DC's 18 previous studio albums, toured in support of his 2014 solo debut, \"Head Job\". It was the release of that album that led indirectly to Rudd's arrest, with the drummer allegedly so angry at a personal assistant over the way the record was promoted that he threatened to have the man and his daughter killed.\n\nAC/DC postponed the last 10 dates of its spring 2016 North American trek after Johnson was advised to stop playing live or \"risk total hearing loss.\" The band went on to complete the European and North American legs of its \"Rock Or Bust\" tour with GUNS N' ROSES frontman Axl Rose as a \"guest vocalist.\" At the time, Johnson had been AC/DC's singer for 36 years, ever since replacing the late Bon Scott in 1980 and making his debut on the classic \"Back In Black\" album.\n\nTo enable him to perform live with AC/DC again, the now-77-year-old Johnson worked with audio expert Stephen Ambrose, who said he could help resolve the singer's hearing problems.\n\nAmbrose, who invented the wireless in-ear monitors that are widely used by touring artists today, claimed to have invented a new type of ear-bud that would allow Johnson to perform without causing further damage to his eardrums. After three years of experimenting and \"miniaturizing\" the equipment, Johnson previously said the technology could allow him to tour again.\n\nChaney is best known as the bassist of JANE'S ADDICTION and as a member of Alanis Morissette's touring and recording band. Chaney was also a member of TAYLOR HAWKINS AND THE COATTAIL RIDERS and CAMP FREDDY, as well as being a prolific and versatile session musician, having played with artists including Joe Cocker, Shakira, Slash and Avril Lavigne to Sara Bareilles, Gavin Degraw, Cher, SHINEDOWN and Celine Dion. Chaney is also a founding member and partner in the all-star supergroup ROYAL MACHINES along with Dave Navarro (JANE'S ADDICTION),Mark McGrath (SUGAR RAY),Josh Freese (FOO FIGHTERS) and Billy Morrison (BILLY IDOL).\n\nBassist Cliff Williams announced his retirement at the end of AC/DC's 2015-2016 \"Rock Or Bust\" tour, which also saw Johnson leaving. However, Williams — and Johnson — took part in the recording sessions that resulted in \"Power Up\". Both of them were also part of the AC/DC lineup that performed at Power Trip.\n\nDuring an October 2020 interview with Dean Delray's \"Let There Be Talk\" podcast, Cliff was asked if Johnson's departure from the road was what led to his desire to stop touring. Cliff responded: \"It was before then. I spoke to Angus about it initially. I was at a point — and this is at the beginning of the 'Rock Or Bust' tour — that I just felt, for me, it was time to hang it up. I knew that I didn't wanna keep doing these two-year tours, and I didn't wanna hold them back, so I made them aware of the fact that this was gonna be my last go-round. It was a tough tour to finish. God bless Axl for coming in and helping us out, finish it up. He did a great job. And at the end of that, I was definitely — that was it for me. Done — just done. That compounded the whole thing.\"\n\nAccording to Williams, he wanted to take part in the recording sessions for \"Power Up\" as a tribute to Angus's late brother, founding AC/DC rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, who died in 2017 from effects of dementia at age 64. Malcolm is credited as a writer on all 12 tracks on \"Power Up\".\n\n\"If 'Back In Black' has [late AC/DC singer] Bon Scott all over it, for me, 'Power Up' has got Malcolm Young,\" Cliff said. \"This is for him. And it's the band that we played together with for 40-plus years. And I wanted to do that — I wanted to come back and do that.\n\n\"We did some rehearsals earlier [in 2020] before this darn COVID thing popped up, and we had great rehearsals,\" he continued. \"The band was playing really well. So [they asked me], 'Do you wanna do a few shows? 'Sure'. A few shows. We were planning on doing that. Everyone goes home to their respective homes, and bang, we've been here ever since [because of the coronavirus-related shutdown].\"\n\nCliff went on to confirm that his commitment to AC/DC was only for \"a few\" dates in support of \"Power Up\".\n\n\"For both [my mental and physical] health,\" he said. \"I definitely have some physical issues, which I won't bore you with the details of. But, yeah, it's tough. I'm very grateful for everything. It's been fantastic. But I just don't wanna do that anymore.\"\n\nWilliams previously revealed that a \"terrible\" bout with vertigo contributed to his 2016 retirement. He also admitted the return of both Johnson and drummer Phil Rudd convinced him to rejoin the group. \"It was like the old band back together,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"It was not like starting over again, but as close to the band that's been together for 40-plus years as we can possibly make it. I didn't want to miss that.\"\n\nThe follow-up to 2014's \"Rock Or Bust\", \"Power Up\" was recorded over a six-week period in August and September 2018 at Warehouse Studios in Vancouver with producer Brendan O'Brien, who also worked 2008's \"Black Ice\" and \"Rock Or Bust\".\n\nHigh Voltage Pop Up Store in Los Angeles, CA will be open April 17. 2025 noon to 10pm andApril 18, 2025 11am to 5pm #Poweruptour",

The nomination round of voting takes place from June 12 to June 23, with the official Emmy nominations announced Tuesday, July 15. Afterwards, final voting commences on August 18 and ends the night of August 27. The 77th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards are set to take place on Sunday, September 14, and air live on CBS at 8:00 p.m. ET/ 5:00 p.m. PT.\n\nPrior to the most recent Emmys, where Lamorne Morris earned both a surprise nomination and win for his turn in the fifth season of “Fargo,” the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie race usually saw one contender breeze their way toward a victory with little competition. For instance, “Black Bird” star Paul Walter Hauser and “The White Lotus” star Murray Bartlett had their shows premiere a full year before final voting started, and therefore collected multiple trophies well before winning their Emmy. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Stories Everything Coming to Hulu and Disney+ in May TV Title Themes Can Be Hiding in the Show Itself \n\nThis year, the narrative is slightly closer to that. The Netflix hit “Adolescence” just premiered in March, but within a week there were people already calling that breakout star Owen Cooper will win the Emmy. Prior to that, the only other names that have been in the mix based on winter TV awards have been Javier Bardem for “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” and Diego Luna for “La Máquina.” One could argue Liev Schreiber from “The Perfect Couple” as well, since he won the Critics Choice Award, but that group does not have as much overlap or influence on the Television Academy as the SAG Awards or Golden Globes. Even Jesse Plemons for “Zero Day” seems like a greater priority for Netflix, since that show seems to have a chance at breaking into more Emmys categories than Schreiber’s.\n\nSome of the earlier premieres that received awards wins and nominations but did not have their supporting actors recognized are series like HBO’s “The Penguin,” which features actors like Rhenzy Feliz and Clancy Brown; “Presumed Innocent” with Peter Sarsgaard and Bill Camp; and fellow Apple TV+ series “Disclaimer,” which had significant roles for Oscar nominees Sacha Baron Cohen and Kodi Smit-McPhee.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly “Adolescence” and “The Penguin” have been true blue hits in the limited series space this season, so they may take up all the nomination slots. However, Emmys voters have proven to seek out FX and Hulu for their limited series, so “Good American Family” stars Mark Duplass and Dule Hill, or even “Dying for Sex” star Rob Delaney, all have a shot based on the ideas that voters seem more inclined to give their shows a try.\n\nThough we have a sense of the leads, sight unseen, Netflix’s “Sirens” and Amazon Prime Video’s “The Better Sister” are two more series that could provide some contenders. There is also a big question as to whether the stars of any Outstanding TV Movie contenders, like Don Johnson in “Rebel Ridge,” or the men of “Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy” make it in, but those projects are all still building an audience.\n\nCurrent Contenders (In Alphabetical Order):Javier Bardem, “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story” (Netflix)Sacha Baron Cohen, “Disclaimer” (Apple TV+)Clancy Brown, “The Penguin” (HBO)Owen Cooper, “Adolescence” (Netflix)Rob Delaney, “Dying for Sex” (FX)Mark Duplass, “Good American Family” (Hulu)Rhenzy Feliz, “The Penguin” (HBO)Dule Hill, “Good American Family” (Hulu)Samuel L.
