IT'S DISTINGUISHED AS PRIMARY OR SECONDARY. PRIMARY LICHENIFICATION CAN BE INDUCED BY FACTORS LIKE STRESS, ANXIETY, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, INSECT BITES, TIGHT CLOTHING, DRY SKIN, OR NERVE IRRITATION. SECONDARY LICHENIFICATION USUALLY DEVELOPS DUE TO AN EXISTING SKIN CONDITION THAT CAUSES ITCHING AND SCRATCHING. \n\nTHE SYMPTOMS CAN VARY AMONG INDIVIDUALS DUE TO DIFFERING SKIN TONES. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF ASIAN DESCENT MAY HAVE THICK, SCALY PLAQUES WITH DISTINCT BORDERS, WHILE THOSE WITH DARKER SKIN TONES MAY DISPLAY SHADES OF PURPLE, GRAY, OR DARK BROWN. \n\nREPEATED SCRATCHING OR RUBBING CAN LEAD TO LICHENIFICATION, CAUSING A VICIOUS CYCLE OF INCREASED ITCHING AND SKIN THICKENING, AND SUBSEQUENTLY, LONG-TERM CHANGES IN SKIN TEXTURE AND COLOR. LICHENIFICATION IS MORE PREVALENT AMONG PEOPLE WITH DARKER SKIN TONES, AS ECZEMA SYMPTOMS CAN BE LESS NOTICEABLE INITIALLY, RESULTING IN DELAYED TREATMENT AND INCREASING THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE ITCHING AND WIDESPREAD ECZEMA, HENCE MAKING IT TOUGH TO PREVENT LICHENIFICATION.\n\nTO DIAGNOSE, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY EXAMINE THE SKIN, ASK ABOUT SYMPTOMS, TRIGGERS, AND FAMILY HISTORY, AND MAY ALSO ORDER CERTAIN TESTS. \n\nTREATMENT AIMS AT DISRUPTING THE ITCH-SCRATCH CYCLE TO ALLOW SKIN HEALING. IT CAN INCLUDE SKINCARE, TOPICAL TREATMENTS, AND OTHER MEDICATIONS. FOR DARKER SKIN, EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MANAGE SEVERE SYMPTOMS. \n\nLIVING WITH LICHENIFICATION CAN BE DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY IF SKIN CHANGES AFFECT SELF-ESTEEM. HOWEVER, A PROPER SKINCARE ROUTINE AND ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBED MEDICATION CAN HELP MANAGE ITCHING AND PROMOTE HEALING. \n\nTREATMENT AND TIME CAN SOFTEN THE THICK SKIN AND BRING IT BACK TO NORMAL, ALTHOUGH SOME COLOR OR TEXTURE CHANGES MIGHT REMAIN, ESPECIALLY IF THE LICHENIFICATION WAS LONG-STANDING BEFORE TREATMENT. IF YOUR SYMPTOMS AREN'T IMPROVING OR YOU'RE UNSURE WHAT'S CAUSING THEM, IT'S ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. THEY CAN HELP DEVISE OR REVISE YOUR CARE PLAN.",

IT'S DISTINGUISHED AS PRIMARY OR SECONDARY. PRIMARY LICHENIFICATION CAN BE INDUCED BY FACTORS LIKE STRESS, ANXIETY, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER, INSECT BITES, TIGHT CLOTHING, DRY SKIN, OR NERVE IRRITATION. SECONDARY LICHENIFICATION USUALLY DEVELOPS DUE TO AN EXISTING SKIN CONDITION THAT CAUSES ITCHING AND SCRATCHING. \n\nTHE SYMPTOMS CAN VARY AMONG INDIVIDUALS DUE TO DIFFERING SKIN TONES. FOR EXAMPLE, THOSE OF ASIAN DESCENT MAY HAVE THICK, SCALY PLAQUES WITH DISTINCT BORDERS, WHILE THOSE WITH DARKER SKIN TONES MAY DISPLAY SHADES OF PURPLE, GRAY, OR DARK BROWN. \n\nREPEATED SCRATCHING OR RUBBING CAN LEAD TO LICHENIFICATION, CAUSING A VICIOUS CYCLE OF INCREASED ITCHING AND SKIN THICKENING, AND SUBSEQUENTLY, LONG-TERM CHANGES IN SKIN TEXTURE AND COLOR. LICHENIFICATION IS MORE PREVALENT AMONG PEOPLE WITH DARKER SKIN TONES, AS ECZEMA SYMPTOMS CAN BE LESS NOTICEABLE INITIALLY, RESULTING IN DELAYED TREATMENT AND INCREASING THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE ITCHING AND WIDESPREAD ECZEMA, HENCE MAKING IT TOUGH TO PREVENT LICHENIFICATION.\n\nTO DIAGNOSE, HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY EXAMINE THE SKIN, ASK ABOUT SYMPTOMS, TRIGGERS, AND FAMILY HISTORY, AND MAY ALSO ORDER CERTAIN TESTS. \n\nTREATMENT AIMS AT DISRUPTING THE ITCH-SCRATCH CYCLE TO ALLOW SKIN HEALING. IT CAN INCLUDE SKINCARE, TOPICAL TREATMENTS, AND OTHER MEDICATIONS. FOR DARKER SKIN, EARLY AND AGGRESSIVE TREATMENT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MANAGE SEVERE SYMPTOMS. \n\nLIVING WITH LICHENIFICATION CAN BE DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY IF SKIN CHANGES AFFECT SELF-ESTEEM. HOWEVER, A PROPER SKINCARE ROUTINE AND ADHERENCE TO PRESCRIBED MEDICATION CAN HELP MANAGE ITCHING AND PROMOTE HEALING. \n\nTREATMENT AND TIME CAN SOFTEN THE THICK SKIN AND BRING IT BACK TO NORMAL, ALTHOUGH SOME COLOR OR TEXTURE CHANGES MIGHT REMAIN, ESPECIALLY IF THE LICHENIFICATION WAS LONG-STANDING BEFORE TREATMENT. IF YOUR SYMPTOMS AREN'T IMPROVING OR YOU'RE UNSURE WHAT'S CAUSING THEM, IT'S ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH A HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. THEY CAN HELP DEVISE OR REVISE YOUR CARE PLAN.",
